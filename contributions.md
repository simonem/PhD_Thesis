Contribution 1 of the thesis comprises new knowledge about how theoretical concepts in the CSRL model can be mapped to technologies and implemented in tools. It also includes an empirical evaluation of the model in the field of crisis training.

The CSRL model developed by Krogstie et al. [-@Krogstie:fo] and summarised in Chapter X presents a cycle of four stages to conceptualise reflection at work. For each stage a set of reflection-useful activities that can be enhanced by technology are presented. During this PhD work two of the four stages of the model,*plan and do work* and *conduct reflection session*, have been instantiated and specific activities from each stage have been supported by technology tools (Figure X). 

During *plan and do work* the *monitor work* and *do work* activities have been supported. The *monitor work* activity has been addressed by WATCHiT (P3) by enabling capturing a wide spectrum of qualitative and quantitative data; the *do work* activity has been supported by Don’t Panic by generating realistic work experiences that push workers towards taking actions typical of work under stress.

During *Conduct reflection session* CroMAR (P1) supports a wide range of activities. First it makes *related experiences available* by aggregating data about work-experiences of colleagues (captured by WATCHiT). Thanks to augmented reality CroMAR allows to visualise data while situated in a physical context that help *reconstruct or envision work experience*. Data visualised can be compared with the physical environment that helps making sense of experiences.
