\section{Research abroad}\label{research-abroad}

Yet, as pointed out by Edelson \autocite*{Edelson:2002kp}, ``design plays a critical role in the development of theories, not just their evaluation''. The work in this thesis contributed with knowledge useful for validating the CSRL model described in \autocite{Krogstie:2013kf} (as in P2), in defining new theories about how technology can support reflective learning (P6) and in drafting design challenges to develop data capturing tools (P3).

Those constructs came as output of an effort towards generalising the experience earned with the design and construction of prototypes, and knowledge that surfaced from field studies to other application domains. Research results were hence brought to domains that might benefit from the novel interaction techniques to support reflection developed in this research work. To accomplish this goal, I compared the results obtained with other case studies in the MIRROR project, reported in P6 and I conducted research abroad, as guest researcher, at City London University and MIT. During a total of twenty-six weeks time abroad, I joined projects run by the respective institutions doing design and prototypes construction work inspired by the results of this PhD (Figure \ref{research-abroad}).

During fourteen weeks spent at City University (one of the partners of the MIRROR consortium) I investigated the design and production of a digitally augmented serious game for better training of dementia carers, under the supervision of professor Neil Maiden. The game has been implemented and evaluated in eight care homes in the greater London area, and is reported in a joined publication to be submitted.

During twelve weeks spent at the MIT SENSEable City Lab I investigated the design and production of a tangible interface to promote user engagement and reflection about urban-mobility data under the supervision of professor Carlo Ratti. The work has been has been displayed to the public in two exhibitions: ``Wave'' currently held in Paris and ``CNR Internet Festival'' held in Pisa, Italy.\todo{these two paragraphs report on result, and they are already reported in the introduction.
