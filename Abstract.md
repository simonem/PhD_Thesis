*Background+Problem:* Crisis management work entails a set of inter-organisational activities to provide help to the people in need. Continuous training for preparedness enable crisis workers and managers to achieve better performances and commitment to the job. To achieve those goals the body of research in reflective learning provide theoretical tools to guide data-driven, collaborative reflection on work experiences towards change in behaviour. Computer support for reflective learning facilitate the process by providing user interfaces for capturing experiences, visualising discrepancies as reflection triggers; and by supporting sharing of learning outcomes. Yet current IT tools don’t consider the very specific, situated nature of crisis work. While data capturing tools lack of interaction paradigms suitable for being used in-action, visualisation tools struggle in providing the user with the context information needed to ground reflection on-action and achieve valuable learning outcomes.

*Goal:* The research in this thesis is based on the assumption that theory in the field of tangible, embodied and embedded interaction can inform the design of computer interfaces to better assist reflection processes in the specific case of crisis training. This thesis explores how conceptual tools from reflection theory can be implemented in technology to make the data collection process lightweight and pervasive, and interaction with reflection-useful information tangible, situated and playful.

*Method:* To this aim an exhaustive set of user studies, hardware and software prototyping iterations and tools evaluations in crisis drills have been conducted. User studies allowed the author to gain an understanding of the crisis domain, prototypes allowed to discuss early to late design ideas to meet the need of end users, evaluations provided validated the results accomplished. Studies were arranged in cooperation with partners of the EU funded MIRROR project. Software and hardware rapid prototyping techniques, opens source tools and digital manufacturing have been extensively used. New application domain for the use of the technology developed have been investigated during academic visits at City London University and MIT. Commercial exploitation for the results from research are being discussed.

*Contributions:* The resulting contributions, targeting the HCI and ISCRAM communities, include an understanding of challenges for designing, implementing and evaluating technology for the crisis sector. This contribution has driven the design and development of prototypes for data collection in-action and can aid crisis organisations and ICT companies to develop future applications. The main contribution of this PhD work is a suite of applications to comprehensively address experience-based learning. Target users are field workers and disaster managers. The design draws from user studies, and a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art. During crisis training events field workers are empowered for *capturing* work experiences by “WATCHiT”, a wearable computer featuring a distraction-free embodied user interface and sensor modules. Later during debriefings, experiences are *re-created* in-situ using “CroMAR”, which features augmented reality interaction and allows for exploiting the physical space for contextualising the reflection process. Furthermore new, realistic work experiences can be *generated* for continuous training with “Don’t Panic” which employs gamification and technology-augmented game pieces to teach soft skills, and by “Trainer” a mobile app for rescue protocol training. Together the four applications bring a new approach to experiential learning for the crisis domain.
