*Background and Problem:* A crisis is a sequence of alarming events that put groups of people in danger. It can ultimately lead to a disaster (e.g. an hurricane or a nuclear explosion) provoking huge damages and loss of human lives. Crisis management work entails a set of inter-organisational activities, to provide help to the communities struck by a crisis. Continuous training for preparedness enables crisis workers (e.g. firefighters, paramedics, managers) to achieve better performances and commitment to the job. To achieve those goals the body of research in reflective learning provide theoretical tools to guide data-driven, collaborative reflection on work experiences towards changes in behaviour. ICT support for reflective learning facilitates the process by providing user interfaces for capturing work experiences, visualising discrepancies as reflection triggers; and by supporting sharing of learning outcomes. Yet current IT tools don’t consider the very specific, situated nature of crisis work. While data capturing tools lack interaction paradigms suitable for being used in-action, visualisation tools struggle in providing the user with context information needed to ground reflection on-action and achieve structured learning outcomes that can be easily shared among colleagues.

*Goal:* The research in this thesis is based on the assumption that theory in the field of embodied and sensing-baed interaction can inform the design of computer interfaces to better assist reflection processes in the specific case of crisis training. This thesis explores how conceptual tools from reflective learning theory can be implemented in technology tools to make the capture of work experiences lightweight and pervasive, and interaction with reflection-useful information tangible, situated and playful.

*Method:* The work was grounded on design science methodology. Six field studies have been performed during large physical simulations of crisis work. Exploratory studies drove the design and production of eight prototypes of sensing-based interfaces. Software and hardware rapid prototyping techniques, opens source tools and digital manufacturing have been largely employed. Prototypes were eventually returned to the field and tested against acceptance, usability and impact on learning. Results from evaluations were used to validate existing theories and in the development of new constructs. New application domain for the use of the technology have been investigated during academic visits at City London University and MIT. Commercial exploitation of research outcomes are being discussed.

*Contributions:* The resulting contributions, targeting the HCI and ISCRAM communities, include an understanding of challenges for designing, implementing and evaluating technology for the crisis sector. This contribution has driven the design and development of prototypes for data collection in-action and can aid crisis organisations and ICT companies to develop future applications. The main contribution of this PhD work is a suite of applications to comprehensively address experience-based learning. Target users are field workers and disaster managers. The design draws from user studies, and a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art. During crisis training events field workers are empowered for *capturing* work experiences by “WATCHiT”, a wearable computer featuring a distraction-free embodied user interface and sensor modules. Later during debriefings, experiences are *re-created* in-situ using “CroMAR”, which features augmented reality interaction and allows for exploiting the physical space for contextualising the reflection process. Furthermore new, realistic work experiences can be *generated* for continuous training with “Don’t Panic” which employs gamification and technology-augmented game pieces to teach soft skills, and by “Trainer” a mobile app for rescue protocol training. Together the four applications bring a new approach to experiential learning for the crisis domain.
