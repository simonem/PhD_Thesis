*Title*: CroMAR: Mobile Augmented Reality for Supporting Reflection on Crowd Management

*Authors*: Simone Mora, Alessandro Boron and Monica Divitini

*Authors’ contributions*: Mora lead the design research and reported results in the paper. Boron developed the described prototyped and described its technical implementation. Divitini provided feedback throughout both the design and writhing processes. 

> *Abstract: * This paper discusses the usage of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) to support reflection on past events, us- ing reflection on crowd management as scenario. Computer based support to reflection generally relies on the visualization of information connected to the experience one is reflecting upon. Different metaphors have been adopted to support easy access to relevant information within the reflection process, e.g., timelines and word clouds. In this context, MAR represents an interesting alternative because it can be used to promote reflection in the specific location of the event by augmenting it with relevant information. In this way, the authors can expect the reflection process to be grounded in a context that helps to make sense of the infor- mation and reflect on alternative paths of action. The paper presents the scenario of usage, together with the design, development, and evaluation of the prototype, CroMAR. Based on this experience, the authors identify challenges connected to the usage of Mobile Augmented Reality in terms of support for reflection, interaction, and design methodology.

*Description*: This paper investigates the adoption of Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) to support debriefing of work practices that rely on management of resources in space. To date, it is the first time that MAR is used for such purpose. Crowd management, an activity performed by civil protection organisation during large public event, is used to build a case in favour of the use of augmented reality to support reflection processes after the event is concluded. Crowd management is critical both for crisis preparedness and during crisis management. 

CroMAR, an iPad app designed by the authors, is presented as a demonstrator of the use of MAR for reflection. The system developed focuses on supporting navigation of reflection-useful information along the time and space dimension. Also the system provide support in involving others in the reflection process and in sharing of the outcomes. 

The proposed design has been implemented in a working prototype running on iPads, with focus on modularity and extensibility. The prototype has been evaluated in a focus group with experts. The study highlighted challenges in supporting learning with MAR tools and the overall user experiences. First it required a better understanding of the conditions that makes MAR a better approach compared to other information visualisation tools (e.g. maps, timelines). Second, it claimed the need for providing scaffolding mechanisms to the reflection process to make sure that relevant information for a given session is explored. Acknowledged by experts that physical exploration of space provide scaffolding for exploration of information, it is necessary to study when the effectively actually promotes reflection. The user experience with the prototype is hampered by lack of functionalities and lack of suitable hardware platforms. The experience is disrupted by the lack of tools for filtering the data visualised, to remove redundant information and prioritise the important one. On the other side, the choice of iPads 2 has limitation due to device weight and size which can only be comfortably hold by the user for a few minutes.

The results from this paper have fed new design iterations for CroMAR. The design of new functionalities has followed more closely the guidelines provided by the CSRL model that was being developed. At the same time lighter and smaller version of the iPad came to the market which allowed an extended use for our system. A new prototype of CroMAR and its closer mapping to the CSRL model is described in P2.

*Relation to the research questions: * The paper started the investigation of RQ2, “How tangible and playful interaction
with digital information can help in engaging reflection processes?”  

## Paper 2

*Title:* Supporting Debriefing with Sensor Data: A Reflective Approach to Crisis Training 

*Authors:* Simone Mora and Monica Divitini

*Authors’ contributions:* Both Mora and Divitini wrote the paper. Mora lead the design process for the technology presented. Both authors attended the evaluation studies.

> *Abstract:* In this paper we present our exploration into the use of sensor data to promote debriefing after training events simulating work experiences. In this way we address one of the core challenges of crisis training, namely the difficulty to exploit the full potential of training events, e.g. during drills. The paper is theoretically grounded in the theory of reflective learning. The theoretical understanding is used for informing the design of WATCHiT, a wearable device for collecting sensor data during an event, and two applications for promoting debriefing in two different scenarios, CroMAR and Procedure Trainer. CroMAR supports disaster managers during in-situ debriefing after large events, while Procedure Trainer supports a team in reflecting after the simulation of a medical emergency procedure. The evaluation of the two applications shows that sensor data can be successfully used to support debriefing in both scenarios. Based on our experience, we draw lessons learned for the design of systems supporting debriefing in training events.

*Description:* The paper focuses on supporting with sensor data the activity of debriefing after training events simulating work experiences (e.g. drills). To increase the efficacy of debriefing, and thus their impact on crisis preparedness, it is important to exploit the full potential of training events, which are costly to organise. Yet there are different forms of debriefing all complex activity that may vary in terms of details and people involved according with the emergency scenario workers have been training on. Also they are made difficult by the highly distributed nature of the work, the co-existence of different partial experiences and lack of data to complement human memories of the event. The paper addresses those challenges presenting an ecology of three applications of technology to assist two different debriefing scenarios.  Two applications: CroMAR and WATCHiT have been described in P1 and P3 and are here presented in the last stage of their evolution. Trainer is an smartphone application to support a quick reflection session on the implementation of protocols (e.g. medical procedures) that can be done by the worker herself or in a team. The three applications have been evaluated during simulated crisis work events attended by the authors. Also technology mapping with the CSRL model is made explicit. 

The paper contributes presenting lesson learnt, derived from the authors experiences in building the systems and results from evaluations, of the use of sensor data for supporting debriefing. Those propositions can be used by systems designers to create technologies both to capture and visualise data with the goal to better support reflection during debriefings. *First* it is acknowledged that sensor data has to be complemented by qualitative informantion in order to set the right focus for reflection and avoid over-sighting qualitative, yet critical aspects of the work that cannot be captured with technology. *Second* it suggests the use of *visualisation* and *storytelling* as tools as mechanisms to promote sense making process that make data useful. Visualisation helps making sense of the data by *re-creating* a context that help spotting discrepancies with other data source that in turns trigger reflection. For this goal it is important that systems allow to compare data against a baseline or other source. Storytelling happens when a visualisation need to be interred and explained both to the self and to others, connecting it to the human memory of the event; as we observed during evaluations. Also, how to motivate the user in capturing data needed for visualisation and storytelling is still an open challenge. *Third*, the proposed technologies aims at bringing debriefings out of the traditional office setting but not as substituting, rather to complement the current practices creating smooth transition among different debriefing (and thus reflection) cycles.
