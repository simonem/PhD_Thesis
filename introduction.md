### Problem Statement

In this thesis I investigate how to employ theory and technology tools to provide better training to crisis workers.
In the context of crisis training, experience-based learning is a powerful tool. Each crisis can be considered as an unique event that will not take place again under the same circumstances. Even crisis events simulated for training purposes are arranged rarely due to high costs [REF]. Being able to learn from unique work experiences of the different roles on field (first responders, team coordinators, disaster managers) can bring learning outcomes to complement the traditional protocol training [REF]. 

Learning from experiences entails reflection (Boud et al. 1985b, Dewey 1933, Kolb and Fry 1975). Reflection on action has been a research topic since the work of Dewey (Dewey 1933) that describes how we learn by comparing our expectations to new and past experiences in order to promote continuous learning. Reflecting on action is critical to learn from past experiences and performing better in the future (Boud et al., 1985),(Schön, 1983) and a number of technology tools have been developed to support reflection, as an individual or collaborative activity.

The CSRL (Computer Supported Reflective Learning) model developed as part of the MIRROR project [REF] identifies four stages of reflection [REF]: *do work*, *initiate reflection session*, *conduct reflection session* and *apply reflection outcomes*.

In the context of crisis training reflective learning can be framed within three activities: (i) capturing work experiences  (ii) aggregating and visualising experiences and (iii) re-creating experiences. The three activities are required for reflection

Each of the three activities presents several challenges for the workers. Capturing experiences has to be done in-action and must not obstruct the work, moreover the information useful to be captured depends on the specific crisis and the role of the worker. Aggregating and visualising experiences need tools to contextualise raw data and to help spotting discrepancies between experiences that activate reflection. Finally recreating experiences allows for 
  

In this thesis I investigate how to provide better crisis training leveraging implementing theory in computer supported reflective learning (CSRL) in
to leverage theory in Tangible and embedded interaction and in computer supported reflective learning to create technologies for assisting better, experience-based, crisis training. I believe that making the interaction with work experiences stored as digital content tangible would help collaborative making sense processes. Playful interactions could engage practitioners by providing trigger reflection process. By allowing user to capture their work experiences with unobtrusive technology we can use the everyday context of practitioner as learning material. 

Tangible and embodied user interfaces are a recent trend in HCI aiming at enabling interaction with digital information exploiting the affordances that everyday objects provides, rather than traditional input devices such as keyboard, mouse or touchscreen. Using sensor-based technology, conventional object can be augmented and turned in “physical handles” to digital operations [REF], linking their traditional affordances to new digital meanings.  




### Research questions
MRQ: How systems featuring embodied and sensor-based interaction techniques can introduce new opportunities to promote reflection on work experiences?

To answer the MRQ the work has been broken down into three sub-questions:

RQ1: How sensor-based interfaces can enable pervasive and unobtrusive data collection at work?

RQ2: How tangible and playful interaction with digital information can help in engaging reflection processes?

RQ3: How digital manufacturing and open source hardware and software can inform rapid prototyping of embodied

While the first two questions aim at investigating the design of systems to support with technology the CSRL tasks of Monitor work and Reconstruct work experiences; the third question investigates the development of tools for rapid prototyping of demonstrators and proof-of-concepts to answer the above mentioned questions. Prototypes lies at the roots of the user-center design methodology adopted in this PhD work, yet prototyping tangible and embodied user interfaces is a complex task that involves a mix of hardware, software and product design skills. The third question investigates how technology toolkits and open-source communities can ease the prototyping phase, shortening the time for production and both resources and skills needed to achieve working prototypes that can be used during evaluations.    

### Results and contributions
### Context of the work
MIRROR: taken and given
The EU-funded MIRROR aims at empowering and engaging employees to reflect on past work performances and personal learning experiences in order to learn in “real-time” and to creatively solve pressing problems immediately.
