### Problem Statement

In this thesis I investigate how to leverage theory in Tangible and embedded interaction and in computer supported reflective learning to create technologies for assisting better, experience-based, crisis training. I believe that making the interaction with work experiences stored as digital content tangible would help collaborative making sense processes. Playful interactions could engage practitioners by providing trigger reflection process. By allowing user to capture their work experiences with unobtrusive technology we can use the everyday context of practitioner as learning material. 

Tangible and embodied user interfaces are a recent trend in HCI aiming at enabling interaction with digital information exploiting the affordances that everyday objects provides, rather than traditional input devices such as keyboard, mouse or touchscreen. Using sensor-based technology, conventional object can be augmented and turned in “physical handles” to digital operations [REF], linking their traditional affordances to new digital meanings.  

Reflective learning has been a research topic since the work of Dewey [REF] that describes how we learn by comparing our expectations to new and past experiences in order to promote continuous learning. Reflecting on action is critical to learn from past experiences and performing better in the future (Boud, Keogh, & Walker, 1985),(Schön, 1983) and a number of tools have been developed to support reflection, as an individual or collaborative activity. The EU-funded MIRROR aims at empowering and engaging employees to reflect on past work performances and personal learning experiences in order to learn in “real-time” and to creatively solve pressing problems immediately.


### Research questions
MRQ: How systems featuring embodied and sensor-based interaction techniques can introduce new opportunities to promote reflection on work experiences?

To answer the MRQ the work has been broken down into three sub-questions:

RQ1: How sensor-based interfaces can enable pervasive and unobtrusive data collection at work?

RQ2: How tangible and playful interaction with digital information can help in engaging reflection processes?

RQ3: How digital manufacturing and open source hardware and software can inform rapid prototyping of embodied
