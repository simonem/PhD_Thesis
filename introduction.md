# Introduction
## Problem Statement

In this thesis I investigate how to employ tools from reflection theory and embedded technology to provide better training to crisis workers. In crisis training, experience-based learning is a powerful tool. Each crisis is likely to be an unique event that will not take place again under the same circumstances. Even simulated crisis events for training purposes are arranged rarely due to high costs. Being able to learn from work experiences of the different roles on field (first responders, team coordinators, disaster managers) can bring learning outcomes to complement traditional formal training. 

Learning from experiences entails reflection [@boud1985reflection; @Dewey:1998ug; @kolb1974toward]. Reflection on action has been a research topic since the work of Dewey [@dewey1933we] that describes how we learn by comparing our expectations to new and past experiences in order to promote continuous learning. Reflecting on action is critical in order to learn from past experiences and performing better in the future [@boud1985reflection; @Schon:1983ut] and a number of technology tools have been developed to support reflection, as an individual or collaborative activity. The CSRL (Computer Supported Reflective Learning) model developed as part of the MIRROR project[^mirror]  identifies a cycle of four stages of reflection [@Krogstie:2013kf]: *do work*, *initiate reflection session*, *conduct reflection session* and *apply reflection outcomes*. 

In the context of crisis training, technology support for the reflective learning cycle addresses two activities: (i) *capturing work experiences* (ii) *re-creating work experiences*. While *capturing work experiences* is done *in-action*, *re-creating work experience* allow for initiating and sustaining a reflection session *on-action*. Technology provides help in different ways. Sensors can capture aspects of work experiences; data which can be visualised on a computer interface to provide triggers for re-evaluating an experience towards a learning outcome, or that can be used to plan new training work. Yet current technology tools don’t consider the very particular, situated nature of crisis work. While data capturing tools lack of interaction paradigms suitable to be used in-action, interfaces to visualise and manipulate data for reflection purposes struggle in providing the users with context information needed to ground the reflection process towards a learning outcome. 

Theory in the field of tangible, embodied and embedded interaction [@Dourish:2001vc] can inform the design of technologies to better assist reflection processes for crisis training. Tangible and embodied user interfaces are a recent trend in HCI aiming at enabling interaction with digital information exploiting the affordances that everyday objects provide, rather than traditional input devices such as keyboard, mouse or touchscreens. Using sensor-based technology, conventional object can be augmented and turned in “physical handles” to digital operations [@Ishii:1997ur], linking their traditional affordances to new digital meanings. Embodied interaction techniques can be implemented in computer interfaces to allow *capturing work experiences* disrupting as little as possible the rescue work and to *re-create work experiences* which are grounded in a physical context and characterised by engaging, playful interaction with digital information.

### Research questions

The main research question for the PhD work is:

> MRQ: How systems featuring embodied and sensor-based interaction techniques can introduce new opportunities to promote reflection on work experiences?

To answer the MRQ the work has been broken down into three sub-questions:

> RQ1: How sensor-based interfaces can enable pervasive and unobtrusive data collection at work?

> RQ2: How tangible and playful interaction with digital information can help in engaging reflection processes?

> RQ3: How digital manufacturing and open source hardware and software can inform rapid prototyping of embodied, sensor-based human-computer interfaces for capturing and visualising reflection-useful data?

While the first two questions aim at investigating the design of systems to support with technology the tasks of capturing and re-creating work experiences; the third question investigates how technology toolkits and open-source communities can ease the prototyping phase, shortening the time for production of working prototypes to be used during evaluations. Prototypes lies at the roots of the user-center design methodology adopted in this PhD work, yet prototyping tangible and embodied user interfaces is a complex task that involves a mix of hardware, software and product design skills.

### Context of the work

The PhD work is framed within the EU-funded (IST-FP7) project MIRROR. The focus of MIRROR is the creation of a set of technology applications that enable employees to learn lessons from their own and others experiences to perform better in the future. As an associate researcher of MIRROR I took part in shaping the results of the projects by designing and implementing applications, writing deliverables and participating in project meetings. Thanks to MIRROR I cooperated with crisis workers associations partner of the consortium to run user studies and prototype evaluations. I also benefited from discussions and joined works and publications with other project partners.

During the PhD I was a visiting researcher in two foreign institutions: City London University and MIT SENSEable City Lab. The purpose of the two visits was to investigate whether the technologies developed during the PhD could be generalised to application domains that share similarities with crisis training. 

During fourteen weeks spent at City University (also partner of MIRROR) I investigated the design and production of a digitally augmented serious game for better training of dementia carers, under the supervision of professor Neil Maiden. The game has been implemented and evaluated in eight care homes in the greater London area, and is reported in a joined publication [submitted] at CHI2015.

During twelve weeks spent at the MIT SENSEable City Lab I investigated the design and production of a tangible interface to promote user engagement and reflection about urban-mobility data under the supervision of professor Carlo Ratti. The work has been has been displayed to the public in two exhibitions: “Wave”  currently held in Paris and “CNR Internet Festival” held in Pisa, Italy.
