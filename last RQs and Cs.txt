RQs


MRQ: What are the opportunities introduced by combining reflective learning theories with sensing-based interfaces for supporting crisis training?

RQ1: How sensing-based interfaces can be designed to enable unobtrusive experience collection during crisis work?

RQ2: How sensing-based interfaces can be designed to trigger and support reflection activities? 

RQ3: How sensing-based interfaces for supporting reflection can be rapidly prototyped? 


C1: Implementation and evaluation of MIRROR Computer Supported Reflective Learning (CSRL) theory.

C2: Knowledge about designing experience-capturing tools for crisis workers.

C3: Novel sensing-based interaction techniques to support re-creation and generation of work experiences in crisis training.

C4: Knowledge about implementing prototypes to be deployed into the wild.
