# Computer supported reflective learning

In order to inform the design of technology to support experiential learning tools for crisis learning, I drove the design work by the Computer Supported Reflective Learning model developed within the MIRROR project. The model has indeed been designed to identify requirement, design and implement technology support for to reflective learning [@Krogstie:2013kf]. 

After a brief introduction about reflection theory I describe the CSRL model and how it has been applied to the development of  technology for crisis experiential learning. In the following I will use the terms *reflective learning* and *reflection* as synonyms.

## Reflection theory

Boud [-@boud1985reflection] defines reflective learning as “a generic term for those intellectual and affective activities in which individuals [...] explore their experiences in order to lead to new understandings and appreciations”, it is both an individual and collective mental process that turns past experiences into new knowledge. This is also in line with the work of Schön [-@Schon:1983ut] who further distinguish between *reflection-in-action* (or *intra-crisis* in the context of this work) and *reflection-on-action* (*inter-crisis*). Reflection consists in three steps process during which the learner re-evaluate her experiences inspecting behaviours, ideas and feelings; eventually deriving conclusions and lessons learned, that guide future behaviours (Figure x). The process can be iterated multiple times and might influence the learner behaviours only in the long term. A key element for the process to happen is the presence of triggers

A key aspect in making a reflective process to happen is the presence of triggers. Triggers are unexpected situations, for example disturbances and perception of uncertainty; but also positive situation like surprising success. In general, reflection seems to be triggered by awareness of discrepancy between expectations and the current experience. Reflection might be triggered by an external event or agent (external trigger/accident) or might develop from one’s own thinking of a whole series of occurrences over time (internal trigger). Reflection can occur incidentally or intentionally, but is widely acknowledged that in both cases reflection is a conscious evaluation of an experience. Furthermore people can learn not only from their own experiences, but also from other’s experience by directly or indirectly (for example by observing and reflecting on other’s experiences). 

Similar to the work of Boud, Kolb [-@kolb1984experiential] describes experiential learning as a cyclic process named “the Kolb Cycle” (Figure x).

According with Kolb reflection is a process that involves not only reinterpreting existing experiences, but also initial perception and interpretation of the raw experience. A description of other existing theories can be found in [@WoodDaudelin199636]

## MIRROR Computer Supported Reflective Learning model

Building on the presented work on reflection theory and on empirical studies the MIRROR project has developed, thought multiple iterations, a model for Computer Supported Reflective Learning (hereafter CSRL model for short). The CSRL model has been designed to identify requirement, design and implement technology support for reflective learning and is detailed in [@Krogstie:2013kf]. Following the work of Boud et al. [-@boud1985reflection] the model considers reflective learning as “the conscious re-evaluation of experience for the purposes of guiding future behaviour […] as reflection transforms experience from work into knowledge applicable to the challenges of daily work” [@Krogstie:fo]. *Work* and *reflection on action* are seen as intertwined activities that have an impact on personal, collaborative and organisational growth.

The model explains reflective learning as a **cycle** involving fours stages of reflection: do work; initiate reflection session; conduct reflection session; and apply reflection outcomes. For each stage, it specifies relevant sub-steps, specific reflection-useful activities that can be augmented with technology. For example, initiate reflection session includes *decide to reflect* and *frame the reflection session*. 



For each stage, the CSRL model identifies support that can be provided through technology, for example in the do work phase, technology can be used to monitor work and collect data that can be useful for reflection, in initiate reflection session technology can be used to set the objectives for reflection or involve others in the session; in conduct reflection session to share work experiences with others; and in apply reflection outcomes to decide how the change to work will be implemented.

A key aspect in making a reflective process to happen is the presence of triggers. Reflection triggers are a critical element of the model because they initiate the reflection session (see central arrows depicted in Figure 1). Reflection can be triggered during work, while a change is about to be applied or during the reflection session itself. For instance, a collaborative reflection in a team meeting may trigger individual reflection of a participant or reflections about organisational topics.

It should be noted that one reflection cycle can also trigger new reflection cycles, for example, when a reflection session include as outcome the need to reflect on a specific aspect of work, e.g. how a crisis procedure is applied, with someone at a higher organisational level. In this way, we can look at reflection as a storyline that might involve different actors within the organisation [@PrPK13]. 

The CSRL model has worked as theoretical underpinning for the development of the applications presented in this PhD work, providing a language guiding for the understanding of reflection and requirements for supporting technology.

Triggers can be external e.g. prompted by a tool

This approach to learning doesn’t follow a predefined goal

## CSRL applied, MIRROR Appsphere

The model has driven the development of several software and hardware applications to address reflective learning in the fields of social care, health care, business and emergency aid. For a description of the apps see [@Schwantzer:2014we]

Computer-supported reflection refers to those systems that support the reflection process by: 
		-  Providing tools for recording and annotating experiences either private or co-constructed with other people (for example personal diary application, or timeline visualization like in [6])  
		-  Providing triggers for reflection (for example reminding the user to reflect on a daily basis)  
		-  Assisting the user by providing relevant information during an ongoing reflection process (for example by allowing to re-evaluate a past experiences from multiple point of views)
