This thesis has focused on enhancing crisis training practices with novel sensing-based technologies to capture, re-create and generate crisis work experiences. 

The main research method adopted was design science. To this respect six field studies during physical simulations of crisis work were performed. Field work and literature in computer supported reflective learning has driven eight prototyping iteration during which complex hardware/software sensing-based devices were built and evaluated both in focus groups and during physical simulations. The work has resulted in seven paper published and five declaration of inventions filed for technology transfer.

The research questions were answered by four contributions.

The computer-supported reflective learning model developed by the MIRROR project (Chapter \ref{csrl}) has been validated by the production of novel ICT systems. First determinate activities described in the model, together with requirements derived from field studies, have driven the selection of relevant sensing-based technologies. Wearable sensors have been selected for capturing experiences at work, mobile augmented reality for re-creating experiences; while tangible user interfaces and board games mechanics were helpful for generating interactive work experiences. The usefulness of those technologies for reflection was demonstrated by the production of working prototypes featuring novel user interfaces. Prototypes were evaluated during physical simulations of crisis management work. Results from questionnaires and interviews show that the systems were compatible with (simulated) rescue work and, though with some limitation, can be useful in supporting reflection processes. Moreover a novel approach to the use of sensor data as learning content emerged. Yet this research work has only considered two of the stages in the model. Further work is required to map with technology the remaining stages. Also the investigation is deeply connected with the specific nature of crisis work. Further work is required to generalise the mapping found to other domains.

**The MIRROR CSRL model can be used to drive the development of technology for support selected reflection activities to for crisis training. Further work is required to complete the missing mapping between model activities and technology, and to generalise the mapping itself to other domains. **

A set of challenges for designing experience-capturing tools during crisis work have been defined. The challenges shed light on what information is relevant as learning content and how to capture relevant information. Moreover the need for capturing both quantitative and user-submitted qualitative data is highlighted. The challenges were addressed during multiple prototyping iteration of WATCHiT a wearable data capturing tools. Combining wearable sensors and modular design has been found as a viable solution to address the challenge to address different capturing needs in different crisis, while wearable sensor well support the highly mobile nature of crisis work in providing pervasive data collection. A user-iteraction paradigm derived by literature in body-centric gesture addressed the challenge for intuitive interaction.
