# Research approach and process

The work in this thesis is based on design research [@Hevner:2010fy] and case study research. The two approaches were chosen for their efficacy in understanding a specific setting -the crisis domain- for which I didn’t have any previous knowledge. The choice of design research was functional to the goal of the work which is not just in building an understanding of crisis learning but also in contributing to the field with the design, implementation and evaluation of technologies for better crisis learning.

At beginning of the research work I used design as an approach to build a deeper understanding of the crisis domain. As pointed out by Edelson [-@Edelson:2002kp] “design plays a critical role in the development of theories, not just their evaluation”. In this phase, design ideas were turned into low to high fidelity prototypes in short iterations. Prototypes presented in focus groups with crisis workers facilitated discussions with users, triggering a better understanding of the domain which in turn brought to new ideas. The specific design decisions I took in implementing prototypes generated lots of suggestions, crisis, and the reminiscence of work episodes. This first phase empirically produced a set of design challenges for the use of technology in crisis work reported in P4. Those challenges evolved in a design space over the course work thanks to new understanding of the crisis domain.

After an extensive literature review, the design challenges identified in P3 were combined with theories from reflection (Chapter 2) and conceptual tools from embodied interaction (Chapter 3) to drive the design of systems presented in P1, P3, P4. Designs were implemented in prototypes throughout multiple iterations. Formative evaluations were performed after each iterations. The systems presented in P1, P3, P4, and P6 involve a combination of software development, hardware (electronics) engineering, product design and manufacturing techniques. Building prototyping pushed me towards improving my technical skills, also it highlighted challenges for rapid prototyping of hardware inventions creating the foundation of a toolkit project described in the future works.

The final part of the research consisted in summative evaluations, theory mapping and redefinition and investigation of new application domains. The systems developed underwent summative evaluations using the toolbox reported in [@Knipfer:2012vi], results were reported in full in [@Renner:v4nLmwOk] and  highlighted in P2 and P7. The systems developed were mapped against the CSRL model in P2, bringing a new understating on the user of sensor data for supporting debriefing. In P4 two of the system developed are used as case studies to present a design approach to turn context data into learning contents. Finally I focused on generalising the results obtained towards building a better understanding of the design and prototyping process of tangible interfaces. This goal has been accomplished during research visit at City London University, reported in P6, and MIT. 

Thought the duration of the work discussion within the MIRROR project has influenced some choices. 

Besides academic research the work has also took an innovation approach. I co-authored five *declaration of inventions* registered at the NTNU Technology Transfer AS[^tto], an innovation accelerator within NTNU. Those inventions are outcome of the work in P1, P3, P4 I met several companies showing interest, in different ways, in bringing a contribution for the commercialisation of my PhD work results. In November I won 150.00NOK (~22.000USD) to turn one idea into a product.

The design process began with an ethnographic study performed during a simulation la maxi emergency held in October 2011.
