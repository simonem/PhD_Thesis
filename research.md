# Research approach and process

The work in this thesis is based on design research [@Hevner:2010fy] and case study research. The two approaches were chosen for their efficacy in understanding a specific setting -the crisis domain- for which I didn’t have any previous knowledge. Choosing design research was functional to the goal of the work, which is not just in building an understanding of the domain but also in contributing to the field with the design of technologies for better crisis learning.

At beginning of the research work I used the design of technology as an approach to build a deeper understanding of the crisis domain. As pointed out by Edelson [-@Edelson:2002kp] “design plays a critical role in the development of theories, not just their evaluation”. In this phase, most of the time was dedicated to user studies during crisis drills and literature review. Early design ideas were turned into low-to-high fidelity prototypes in short iterations. Prototypes presented in focus groups with crisis workers facilitated discussions, triggering a better understanding of the domain, which in turn brought to new ideas. The specific design choices I took, demonstrated in prototypes, generated lots of suggestions and critics among crisis workers. Furthermore, prototypes facilitated the reminiscence of their personal work experiences, which brought new perspectives into the study. This first phase produced a set of empirical design challenges for the use of technology in crisis work reported in P4. Those challenges evolved in a design space over the course of the work thanks to new understanding fed during following user studies.

After an extensive literature review, the design challenges identified in P3 were combined with theories from reflection (Chapter 2) and conceptual tools from embodied interaction (Chapter 3) to drive the design of systems presented in P1, P3, P4. Designs were implemented in prototypes throughout multiple iterations. Formative evaluations were performed after each iterations during user studies of simulated crisis work. The systems presented in P1, P3, P4, and P6 involve a combination of software development, hardware (electronics) engineering, product design and manufacturing techniques. Building prototyping pushed me towards improving my technical skills, also it highlighted challenges for rapid prototyping of hardware inventions creating the foundation of a toolkit project described in the future works. Also it made clear that traditional prototyping techniques might not be suitable to be used in the crisis domain.

The final part of the research consisted in summative evaluations, theory mapping and investigation of new application domains. The systems developed underwent summative evaluations using the toolbox reported in [@Knipfer:2012vi]. Results are reported in full in [@Renner:v4nLmwOk] and highlighted in P2 and P7. The systems developed were mapped against the CSRL model in P2, bringing a new understating on the use of sensor data for supporting debriefing. In P4 two of the system developed were used as case studies to present a design approach to turn context data into learning contents. Finally I focused on generalising the results obtained towards building a better understanding of the design and prototyping process of tangible interfaces. This goal has been accomplished during research visit at City London University, reported in P6, and MIT. 

Throughout the duration of the work discussion with members of the MIRROR consortium helped in shaping and influenced design choices. 

Besides academic research the work in this thesis is characterised by an innovation approach. I co-authored five *declaration of inventions* registered at the NTNU Technology Transfer AS[^tto], an idea accelerator affiliated with NTNU. Those inventions are outcome of the work in P1, P3, P4. In order to asses the market value for the *inventions* I met several companies which showed interest, in different ways, in bringing a contribution for the commercialisation of my PhD work results. In November 2014 one of the invention won 150.00NOK (~22.000USD)  from NTNU Discovery [^discovery] fund as initial seed to commercialise the idea.

The design process began with an ethnographic study performed during a simulation la maxi emergency held in October 2011.
