# Research approach and process

based on ISCRAM literature review and user studies, I didn’t know the crisis domain

I used design and prototyping as a mean to get to know better the crisis domain thought discussions with users that those artefacts facilitate. Many discussions were triggered by the specific design decisions I took in implementing prototpyes. The design process started with challenges and opportunities I observed during user studies and an elaboration, and idea generation throughout partecipatory multiple iterations, on how to respond to them.

The solutions I developed, in terms of prototypes aim at addressing the challenges, within design spaces limited by the constraint proper of the crisis domain. The design space itself wasn’t given a priori but evolved over the course of the design process thanks to new understanding of the crisis domain.

The design process began with an ethnographic study performed during a simulation la maxi emergency held in October 2011. 

user studies methods: observations, interviews, surveys, focus groups

tools used during user studies

current methods hardily applicable: cannot observe real emergencies, prototypes must robust, hard to have access to users, different roles and politics

empirical study?

multiple iterations

bring in tools within learning and hci with a strong focus on rapid prototyping
