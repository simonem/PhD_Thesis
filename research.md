# Research methodology

[Revision 3]

- removed interpretative case studies as methodologies
- removed instantiation of (March, 1995) framework
- Added instantiation of (Havner, 2007) framework, a better fit for the type of work done

The aims of this chapter are to present the research design, to describe methods and tools adopted and how data have been analysed. Although not all of these methods and results have been explicitly reported in the papers, they have been important to understand the users, the domain and the needs. The adopted methods weren’t given a priori but rather they emerged over time.

## Research overview

The work in this thesis is based on design research [@Hevner:2010fy; @March:1995gm]. Design science provides theoretical tools to study and understand a specific domain and processes to build artefacts with the aim at improving an environment [@simon1996sciences]. The work unfolded by interweaving field studies to understand a specific setting and turn opportunities observed into system requirements; with design iterations to build technologies to address those opportunities. The design artifacts produced were both useful for understanding the domain and in adding new knowledge to the domain.

The design science approach meet the aim of this research work, which lies not only in building an understanding of the crisis domain but also in contributing with the design of technologies for better crisis training (RQ1-RQ2). The focus of design science on rapid iterations between the construction of artifacts and their evaluation [@Hevner:2010gc] makes also a good strategy for the investigation of RQ3.

Hevner [-@Havner2004; -@hevner2007three] describes design research as a sequence of three tightly coupled cycles of activities (Figure X). And each of the three cycles must be present and visible in a design science research project [@Hevner:2010gc].

![The design cycles, figure adapted from [@hevner2007three]](imgs/design_cycles.png)

The *relevance cycle* initiates the research by identifying opportunities and problems for a specific domain and deriving requirements for the design of technology to address those. Once the requirements are implemented in design artefacts, acceptance criteria for the summative evaluation are defined and artefacts are introduced into the environment for field testing. Results from field evaluations inform new cycle iterations until research goals are met. **This stage involves designing running field studies with exploratory or evaluation purposes**.

The *rigor cycle* instantiates grounding theories and methods into design activities, and it contributes into the knowledge base with new constructs generated by research. The cycle provides past knowledge to drive design work and to ensure it maintains an innovation approach able to bring research contributions. At the same time, extensions or generalisations of existing theories together with new constructs, knowledge and methods generated by the design process are added to the knowledge base. **This stage includes a continuous process of keeping design work informed by relevant grounding theory and a retrospective theoretical work of validating and extending these theories**. 

The *design cycle* iterates between the production of an artifact, its formative evaluation and it derives feedbacks to further refine the design. The cycle is fed with requirements from the relevance cycle and theories from the rigor cycle; it returns artefacts for field test to the former and knowledge to the advances of theories to the latter. This cycle is characterised by rapid iterations where small incremental improvements in design artefacts are tested before an artefact is released into the field or new knowledge is added to the rigor cycle. **This stage involves the construction of prototypes and successive lab tests**.

To support the cycles activities, qualitative methods [@robson1993real] were largely adopted. Observations, interviews and researchers’ notes were the primary means to collect data on the field. Scenarios and personas drove the design phase. Open source hardware and software tools were largely adopted to turn mockups into working prototypes. Finally questionnaires, interviews and statistic tests were used during formative and summative evaluations. 

The choice of these methods required the researchers to have large access to people, knowledge and protocols of organisations working in the crisis domain. This research strategy was facilitated by having crisis response organisations member of the MIRROR consortium. Moreover, throughout the duration of the work, discussions with members of MIRROR during project meetings and workshops helped in shaping design choices and partially influenced the work.

The following section details on what research activities for each of the three cycle have been performed.

### Relevance cycle

The primary investigation method adopted to understand the crisis domain and to evaluate artefacts produced by the design cycle has been *field studies*. Field studies had a twofold objective. Some studies acted as exploratory research to inform the design of technology, some others as field evaluation for the tools developed. Most of the studies covered both aims. 

An overview of the field studies performed between years 2011-2014, in relation with research questions and papers, is presented in Table X.

#### The setting

The setting for most of the studies was medium to large scale physical simulation of crisis work (drills). Only the first exploratory study (ID:1 in Table X) took place during real work. Objectives of drills were to train workers against protocols, including rescue procedures, and test of equipments (fire extinguishers, protective suits, medical apparatus). Notably, the observed events also offered opportunities for team building and sharing of experiences among workers, as part of official an unofficial social gatherings. 

Although traditional field studies claim that a work practice is best understood observing a real environment [@Beyer:1995:AC:203356.203365], there are issues associated with doing ethnography and testing technology in settings characterised by traumas and emergencies [@Brown:1998:DDM:274644.274723], such as hospitals and crisis scenes. Moreover real crisis poses researchers’ safety at risks and are largely unforeseeable in time and space.\todo{to be deleted? the goal is to study crisis training rather than management}

Physical simulation were arranged and involved personnel of a range of crisis management organisations operating in northern Italy, coordinated by ANPAS-Piemonte[^anpas] and SEIRS[^seirs] organisations. Those institutions were selected because of being affiliated to the MIRROR consortium, which facilitated access to resources and gathering of ethical approval for the research done. Simulated events included participants from a wide range of roles including field workers (firefighters, paramedics, police agents), team coordinators, disaster manager, technical and radio staff. Simulations usually involved dozens of workers, coordinated by one drill manager.

The simulated events tried to follow as much as possible real crisis in terms of physical context and activities. Events span between one to three days, simulating different scenarios including flooding, earthquake and chemical spills. The drills usually took place remote areas, unaccessible to the public, which were set up to recreate harsh conditions like the presence of debris, flooded terrains, fire ashes and broken cars. In this setting, volunteers impersonating the injured to be rescued were located in places undisclosed to the trainees (Figure X-a).

{phases of a typical simulation, A-setup of environment, B-work, C- debriefing}

Each simulated event included *briefing*, *simulation* and *debriefing* phases. During briefing the drill manager described the settings, and distributed duties to teams of rescue workers. During simulation workers were implementing rescue protocols (Figure X-b). The work involved cooperation among: police forces, to handle traffic and fence the operational area, firefighters to explore and secure undisclosed areas, civil protection workers to build field hospitals, dog handlers to search for survivors and teams of paramedics to activate triage, threat of injured and transportation to the nearest field hospital. A collaborative debriefing of the events followed, with focus on time completion for rescue procedure and issues that might have been arisen during the practice (Figure X-c).

#### Data collection methods

Observations, researcher notes and interviews were the primary means to collect data from the field. Workers were shadowed during the simulation. To this respect, my role as observer strived to be, as defined by [-@Walsham:2006bo], *neutral*; meaning that people being shadowed shouldn’t perceive the researcher as biased by previous views on people, processes or organisations. Video recording, performed with both handheld and head-mounted cameras provided multiple point of views on the observed events. Qualitative data collection methods were supplemented by formal protocols, procedures and best practices provided by the organisations involved in the studies. Data captured during the studies were handled in observance of NTNU and MIRROR policies. 

During the studies with evaluation purposes, selected workers previously asked for enrolment in the evaluation study, were provided with prototypes to test. Workers were walked thru the use of technology by a researcher and a set of task to be accomplished was given to each participant. Tasks had to be performed as part of simulated crisis work events, to assess the compatibility for the technology do be employed during the implementation of rescue protocols. Participants’ interaction with the technology was video recorded with wearable cameras, in addittion prototypes were configured to log modes of operation. After each test researchers followed up with interviews and surveys. Questions asked were selected from the toolbox reported in [@Knipfer:2012vi], which has been specifically developed to run user studies within the MIRROR project. 

Results from researchers’ notes, interviews, questionnaires, together with video recording and logs were analysed with qualitative research methods [@robson1993real]. The focus of the analysis was twofold.

During exploratory studies attention was on how practitioners capture aspects of their work experience, to identify what information is relevant for reflection and what interaction modalities are suitable for the use in action. The outcome of this analysis produced a set of requirements to drive the design of technology; including challenges, system requirements, scenarios and personas. This results feeds the *design cycle*.

During evaluation studies the focus was on evaluating how well the artifacts perform against usability and what is the support provided to the implementation of activities in the CSRL model (Chapter X). Usability metrics \todo{need reference?} and a reflection scale provided by the mirror evaluation toolbox [@Knipfer:2012vi] have been adopted. The outcome of this analysis produces both an addition to the requirements for the technology and feeds the *rigor cycle* with knowledge to validate existing theories or to generate new constructs. 

Gather access to people for the studies has proven to be challenging, and no compensation was given against participation to the studies. Training exercises aimed at re-creating aspects of stress and unpredictability typical of real emergencies, for this reason workers were not always prone to share information with researchers. Even more, sometimes the presence of researchers has been seen as disruptive for the training activities. The time of the events set for debriefing and collaborative reflection was also very limited. Despite those challenges I was able to gather enough information to drive the design work. This is mostly thanks to the number of studies performed and to the relationship maintained throughout the years with a group of five workers who I deeply thank.\todo{should I move this paragraph to the evaluation chapter?}


### The design cycle

Concurrently and inspired by field study work, I introduced into the organisations technology to assist the CSRL model (Chapter X). Design work followed a *user centred approach* [@MAGUIRE:2001dp; @Gulliksen:2003hd]. 

At beginning of the study building things helped forging an understanding of the crisis domain. In this phase, mockups were turned into low-fidelity prototypes in short iterations. Prototypes presented in focus groups with workers facilitated discussions, triggering a better understanding of the domain, which in turn led to new ideas. Furthermore, prototypes facilitated the reminiscence of work experiences, brining new perspectives into the study. Finally, in the final stage of the work, prototypes acted as means to validate the CSRL model presented in Chapter X, focusing on the activities of capturing, re-creating and generating work experiences.

The design cycle involved two activities: build and evaluate. *Build* refers to the process of constructing a (technology) artifact for a specific purpose, according with requirements identified by the relevance cycle. *Evaluate* is the process of how well the artifact performs against metrics previously established [@simon1996sciences]. 

#### Build

A large amount of time was dedicated to the construction of technology artefacts, implementing systems’ requirements, scenarios and personas generated in the *relevance cycle*. Literature in sensor-based interfaces (Chapter X) and in Computer supported reflective learning (Chapter X) provided ground to design technology that is intuitive and provide reflection outcomes.

A total of eight prototypes were produced, including mobile apps, wearable sensors and technology-augmented board games. Table X overviews the different prototypes developed and their relation with the papers.

\missingfigure{Overview table of the prototypes developed.}

The construction process involved a mix hardware and software engineering. I largely adopted a rapid prototyping techniques in order to keep design iterations shorts and make incremental improvements based on frequent feedbacks exchanges with end users. To this end a wide range of open source toolkit were used, including Arduino[^arduino] and RaspberryPi[^raspberry] hardware development platforms. Dealing with hybrid hardware/software artefacts, digital manufacturing techniques were largely adopted, including 3D printing and laser-cut production. These activities were essential to develop knowledge to answer RQ3. Building prototypes I was often helped by a few students who have written master theses related to the topics presented in this thesis.

#### Evaluate

After each prototype was built, a formative evaluation followed. Frequent user testing allowed for maintaining a user-centered design perspective, to introduce new ideas into the process, and to test prototypes in a controlled setting before releasing them into field testing along the relevance cycle [@Hevner:2010gc].

To this intent, focus groups with crisis workers were performed. Being the drills described in the *relevance cycle* arranged rarely due to the high organisational and financial efforts required; focus groups with workers were essential for fueling the design activity. Moreover, meetings often involved the same workers who have perviously attended the physical simulations (Table X). It was therefore possible to ground discussions into specific episodes previously observed during field studies.

During focus groups low and high fidelity prototypes were evaluated. Low-fidelity prototypes acted as technology probes [@Hutchinson:2003il]. Despite their evident usability issues, they were essential to create new scenarios of use and identify technological and usage challenges. High-fidelity prototypes were usability tested [@Dumas:2009th], using a SUS scale [@jordan1996usability pag.189]. 
 
### The rigor cycle

The design work was grounded in literature about computer supported reflective learning (Chapter X) and in sensing-based interaction (Chapter Y). While the former identified *what* activities and processes to trigger reflection where to be enhanced with technology; the latter provided guidelines on *how* to design user interfaces for the technologies created.  

Yet, as pointed out by Edelson [-@Edelson:2002kp], “design plays a critical role in the development of theories, not just their evaluation”. The work in this thesis contributed with knowledge useful for validating the CSRL model described in [@Krogstie:fo] (as in P2), in defining new theories about how technology can support reflective learning (P6) and in drafting design challenges to develop data capturing tools (P3). 

Those constructs came as output of an effort towards generalising the experience earned with the design and construction of prototypes, and knowledge that surfaced from field studies to other application domains. Research results were hence brought to domains that might benefit from the novel interaction techniques to support reflection developed in this research work. To accomplish this goal, I compared research results with other case studies in the MIRROR project and I conducted research abroad, as guest researcher, at City London University and MIT. During a total of twenty-six weeks time abroad, I joined projects run by the respective institutions doing design and prototypes construction work inspired by the results of this PhD (Figure X).

\missingfigure{a photo of the prototypes developed during research abroad.}  

During fourteen weeks spent at City University (one of the partners of the MIRROR consortium) I investigated the design and production of a digitally augmented serious game for better training of dementia carers, under the supervision of professor Neil Maiden. The game has been implemented and evaluated in eight care homes in the greater London area, and is reported in a joined publication to be submitted. 

During twelve weeks spent at the MIT SENSEable City Lab I investigated the design and production of a tangible interface to promote user engagement and reflection about urban-mobility data under the supervision of professor Carlo Ratti. The work has been has been displayed to the public in two exhibitions: “Wave” currently held in Paris and “CNR Internet Festival” held in Pisa, Italy.\todo{these two paragraphs report on results. should be moved to another chapter?}  

## Exploitation of research results

During the late phase of the research, the innovativeness of the research performed has been evaluated and basis for a future commercialisation of results have been settled. To this end, I joined forces with NTNU Technology Transfer AS, a business facilitator affiliated with NTNU. I also cooperated with the NTNU School of Entrepreneurship [^es] evaluating the market potential for the technology tools developed.

I co-authored five declaration of inventions. The documents, formalising description and contributors for the inventions, poses the grounds for considering patenting and commercialising research results. 

In order to asses the market value for the inventions I ran technology benchmarks reported in Appendix X\todo{should I add benchmarks and DOFIs in appendix?}. Benchmark results were useful for selecting specific technologies and tools to be employed in the production of prototypes. I also met several representatives from the interests, showing research outcomes and demoing prototypes. I took part in a design challenge at the MIT Media Lab.

In November 2014 one of the invention won 150.00NOK (~22.000USD)  from NTNU Discovery [^discovery] fund to continue innovation work after the completion the PhD.
