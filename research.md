# Research approach and process

based on ISCRAM literature review and user studies, I didnâ€™t know the crisis domain

user studies methods: observations, interviews, surveys, focus groups

tools used during user studies

current methods hardily applicable: cannot observe real emergencies, prototypes must robust, hard to have access to users, different roles and politics

empirical study?

multiple iterations

bring in tools within learning and hci with a strong focus on rapid prototyping

Frequent exchanges of view within MIRROR and with research visits in top level uni

research activities:
* literature review
* user studies
* design
* hw/sw prototypes development
* evaluations
* dissemination of research
* commercialisation of results
* project meetings and management
