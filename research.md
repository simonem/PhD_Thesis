# Research design

The aims of this chapter are to present the research design, to describe methods and tools adopted and how data are analysed. Although not all of these methods and results have been explicitly reported in the papers, they have been important to understand the users, the domain and the needs. The adopted methods weren’t given a priori but rather they emerged over time. 

## Research methodology

The work in this thesis is based on interpretative case study [@Klein:1999bm; @Walsham:2006bo] and design research [@Hevner:2010fy]. The research followed a *user centred approach* process [@MAGUIRE:2001dp; Gulliksen:2003hd], with exploratory studies and design work following in multiple iterations. 

Adopting an interpretative case study approach is motivated by the two first research questions (RQ1-RQ2) which demand to develop un understanding of the crisis domains, for which I didn’t have any previous knowledge. To this goal the primary method adopted was *field study*. Running user studies into the wild, during full scale simulation of crisis response work, was essential in order to build an understanding the settings to design for.

Design research was chosen for its aim at turning requirements  gathered from field studies into prototypes by rapid and incremental iterations, as required by RQ3. Design work was strategic to the aim of this research work, which lies not only in building an understanding of the domain but also in contributing with the design of technologies for better crisis training. Low-fidelity prototypes were evaluated during focus groups with experts, while working prototypes were evaluated during physical simulation of crisis work. 

Qualitative research methods were largely adopted. Observations, interviews and researchers’ notes were the primary means to collect data during field studies. Beside so quantitate data coming from apps logs and formal documents about rescue protocols were also provided. Data analysis methods included video and utterance analysis.\todo{add…}

## Research approach

The research work has been articulated around four activities:

- Understand the crisis domain, its needs and challenges: this has been achieved by exploratory field sutides
- Design technology to provide better crisis training
- Generalise research results to other domains 
- Evaluate the innovation potential for the results

While the first two activities aimed at answering the research questions, the latter provided 

The first objective was to answer the research questions, to this end  Secondary objectives were to assess the innovation and market potential for the results and to investigate generalisation to domains that share similarities with crisis training.

## Research process

At beginning of the research work I used the design of technology as an approach to build a deeper understanding of the crisis domain. As pointed out by Edelson [-@Edelson:2002kp] “design plays a critical role in the development of theories, not just their evaluation”. In this phase, most of the time was dedicated to user studies during crisis drills and literature review. Early design ideas were turned into low-to-high fidelity prototypes in short iterations. Prototypes presented in focus groups with crisis workers facilitated discussions, triggering a better understanding of the domain, which in turn brought to new ideas. The specific design choices I took, implemented in prototypes, generated lots of suggestions and critics among crisis workers. Furthermore, prototypes facilitated the reminiscence of their personal work experiences, which brought new perspectives into the study. This first phase produced a set of design challenges for the use of technology in crisis work reported in P4. Those challenges evolved in a redefined design space over the course of the work thanks to new user studies.

![Timeline of research activities](imgs/timeline.pdf)

After a literature review\todo{add a chapter with the literature review}, the design challenges identified in P3 were combined with theories from reflection (Chapter 3) and conceptual tools from embodied interaction (Chapter 4) to drive the design of systems presented in P1, P3, P4. Designs were implemented in prototypes throughout multiple iterations. Formative evaluations were performed after each iteration during focus groups and drills. The systems presented in P1, P3, P4, and P6 involve a combination of software development, hardware (electronics) engineering, product design and manufacturing techniques. Building prototyping pushed me towards improving my technical skills, also it highlighted challenges for rapid prototyping of hardware inventions (RQ3). Also it made clear that traditional prototyping techniques might not be suitable to be used in the crisis domain.

The final part of the research consisted in summative evaluations, theory mapping and investigation of new application domains. The systems developed underwent summative evaluations using the toolbox reported in [@Knipfer:2012vi]. Results are reported in full in [@Renner:v4nLmwOk], highlights are described in P2 and P7. The systems developed were mapped against the CSRL model in P2, bringing a new understating on the use of sensor data for supporting debriefing. In P4 two of the system developed were used as case studies to present a design approach to turn context data into learning contents. As final activity I focused on generalising the results obtained towards building a better understanding of the design and prototyping process of tangible interfaces for supporting reflection. This goal has been accomplished during research visits at City London University, which work is partially covered in P6, and MIT. 

Throughout the duration of the work discussion with members of the MIRROR consortium helped in shaping design choices and partially influenced the work. 

Besides academic research the work in this thesis is characterised by an innovation approach. I co-authored five *declaration of inventions* registered at the NTNU Technology Transfer AS[^tto], an idea accelerator affiliated with NTNU. Those inventions are outcome of the work in P1, P3, P4. In order to asses the market value for the *inventions* I met several companies which showed interest, in different ways, in bringing a contribution for the commercialisation of my PhD work results. In November 2014 one of the invention won 150.00NOK (~22.000USD)  from NTNU Discovery [^discovery] fund as initial seed to commercialise the idea.

The timeline of the different activity performed during the PhD work is depicted in Figure X. In the following I provide a description of settings, methods and techniques for the user studies performed and for the design and prototype iterations.

## Field studies

The empirical results in this thesis are based on ten studies: six focus groups and 
I worked with crisis association in northern Italy, they were affiliated to MIRROR. Most of the field workers are volunteers. I was able to run user studies and evaluate prototypes during protocol training exercises (e.g. in classroom settings) and small to massive drills involving up to hundred of workers and a dozen of organisations. Although traditional field studies claim that a work practice is best understood observing a real environment [@Beyer:1995:AC:203356.203365], there are issues associated with doing ethnography and testing technology in settings characterised by traumas and emergencies [@Brown:1998:DDM:274644.274723], such as hospitals and crisis scenes. Moreover real crisis poses researchers’ safety at risks and are largely unforeseeable in time and space. The drills the presented field study are based on are organised to provide a high degree of realism, they recreate working conditions that are close as possible to real crises. I was there like

An overview of the field studies performed between years 2011-2014, in relation with research questions and papers, is presented in Table X. Field studies acted both as user studies and for evaluating the systems developed. During the studies I employed several ethnographic methods [@Blomberg:2009tm] including observations, interviews, questionnaires, videotaping, scenarios and personas. Doing ethnography during crisis work exercises presented many challenges. First, exercises unfold in a uncontrolled environment, for example a landfill set up to resemble a real emergency (broken cars, fires, people actings as they are injured or in panic), both at day and night time. The area involved in operations often spans over tens of square kilometers; which makes hard to maintain an overview of activities and observe relevant work episodes. Second, gather access to people for interviews and questionnaires has proven to be challenging. Indeed, training exercises also aim at re-creating aspects of stress and unpredictability typical of real emergencies, therefore worker are often not prone or allowed to share information with researchers. Even more, sometimes the presence of ethnographers has been seen as disruptive for the training activities. The time of the events set for debriefing and collaborative reflection is also very limited. Despite those challenges I was able to gather enough information to drive the design work. This is mostly thanks to the number of studies performed and to the relationship maintained throughout the years with a heterogeneous group of five workers who I deeply thank. 

Data captured during the studies were handled in observance of NTNU and MIRROR policies, consent forms from all the participants in the study were collected.
