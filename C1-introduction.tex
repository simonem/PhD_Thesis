\section{Problem Statement}\label{problem-statement}

This thesis is about how to improve crisis training with ICT systems. Crisis training is an umbrella term for complex, collaborative activities aiming at improving people's ability for \emph{preparedness} to human and natural-caused crises (e.g.~a flood or a terrorist attack) \autocite{Lagadec:1997js}. The term \emph{crisis} refers to a sequence of problematic events that, if left unattended, might eventually lead to a \emph{disaster}, causing huge damage and loss of lives. Disasters have a huge impact on societies, both in terms of human beings and costs: over the last 35 years, the frequency of disasters have increased five-fold; the damage caused has multiplied by approximately eight times\footnote{Source: ``Council adopts new Union Civil Protection Mechanism'' Available at: www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsdata/docs/pressdata/en/jha/140108.pdf.}. According with the United Nation Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, over the decade 1992-2012, disasters have affected 4.4 billion people and have caused 2 trillion USD in damages worldwide\footnote{Source: The United Nation Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (http://unisdr.org)}. For this reason training for better crisis management is a priority for many countries, including the European ones.

Crisis training focuses on teaching emergency workers (e.g.~firefighters, paramedics) how to efficiently respond to a crisis; for example by actuating coping strategies and implementing rescue procedures (crisis management). Each crisis is likely to be a specific, unpredictable event that will not take place again under the same circumstances. Training for crisis preparedness is a wicked problem, however better crisis management can positively affect everyone's lives.

There are four main approaches to crisis training: protocol training, tabletop exercises, physical simulations and serious games; on top of that real crises also offer triggers for learning \autocite{Deverell:2009fk}. In this research work we look at medium to large scale physical simulations and serious games as key training practices; aiming at advancing them with technology. Physical simulations recreate at best real crises in terms of environment (e.g.~presence of debris, collapsed buildings), and in reproducing feelings experienced by crisis worker such as stress, tension, time pressure and uncertainty \autocite{Borodzicz:2002em}. Yet these events are arranged rarely. This is due to the high set-up cost and the large effort required to coordinate multiple organisations and dozens of field workers. Moreover it has been observed that the impact of those events is limited by lack of technologies, for example to capture data and to maintain an overview of rescue efforts \autocite{Kyng:2006he}. Otherwise, serious games trade the realism of physical simulations to provide a more lightweight training experience which can be easily reproduced frequently by single workers or teams. The ``fun'' element typical of games is added as motivator to engage workers in frequent play \autocite{DiLoreto:2012jj}. In this perspective physical simulation and serious games are are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary approaches to crisis training.

\emph{The research in this thesis investigates how maximise crisis training learning outcomes during physical and serious game-based simulation of crisis work. It is based on the absumption that training practices already in place can be enhanced by combining (i) reflective, experience-based learning approaches and (ii) advances in ICT and sensing-based interaction \autocite{Zhai:2005jm}.}\todo{Reforumlate this sentence}

Experience-based learning is a powerful tool. Facilitating learning from work experiences of the different roles on field (e.g.~disaster managers vs.~field workers) can bring outcomes to complement traditional formal training. Learning from experiences entails reflection \autocites{boud1985reflection}{Dewey:1998ug}{kolb1974toward}. Reflection on action has been a research topic since the work of Dewey \autocite{dewey1933we} that describes how we learn by comparing our expectations to new and past experiences. Reflecting on action is critical in order to learn from past experiences with the goal of performing better in the future \autocites{boud1985reflection}{Schon:1983ut}; and a number of tools have been developed to support reflection, as an individual or collaborative activity. Among those, the CSRL (Computer Supported Reflective Learning) model developed as part of the MIRROR project\footnote{MIRROR Project - http://www.mirror-project.eu} aims at providing guidelines to develop technology tools to support reflection. It identifies a cycle of four stages of reflection \autocite{Krogstie:2013kf}: \emph{do work}, \emph{initiate reflection session}, \emph{conduct reflection session} and \emph{apply reflection outcomes}. For each stage a number of reflection-useful activities that can be augmented with technology are provided.

In the context of crisis training, those activities can be summarised in three areas: (i) capturing work experiences, (ii) re-creating work experiences and (iii) generating realistic work experiences. Technology provides help in different ways. Sensors can capture aspects of real or simulated work experiences, including qualitative and quantitative elemtents; data which can be visualised on a interactive computer interface to provide triggers for re-evaluating an experience towards a learning outcome, or that can be used to plan new training work. Yet current technology tools don't consider the very particular, situated nature of crisis work. While data capturing tools lack of interaction paradigms suitable to capture experiences \emph{in-action}, visualisation tools struggle in providing the users with context information needed to ground  reflection \emph{on-action}. Moreover the introduction of technology is obstacled by resistances in organisations that might be reluctant to modify accustomed practices, even if unproductive \autocite{JCCM:JCCM15}.

Theories in the field of \emph{sensing-based interaction}, can inform the design of novel technologies to better assist reflective learning in crisis training. Sensing-based interaction is a trend in HCI which promotes sensing information to make human-computer interfaces, -sensing-based interfaces- more effective \autocite{Zhai:2005jm}. \emph{Tangible} and \emph{embodied} \autocite{Dourish:2001vc} are two characterising traits of such interfaces. They aim at enabling interaction with digital information exploiting the affordances that everyday objects provide, rather than traditional paradigms such as keyboard, mouse or touchscreens. Using sensor-based technology, conventional objects can be augmented and turned in ``physical handles'' to digital operations \autocite{Ishii:1997ur}, linking their traditional affordances to new digital meanings. Making interaction with computers more ``physical'' allows for leveraging humans' skills for interaction with the real world \autocite{Shaer:2009fx}. This approach might be well suited for crisis field work which, contrarily to traditional office work, has a strong physical and spatial connotation. In this perspective, tangible and embodied interfaces have been successfully employed to provide natural \autocite{Terrenghi:2005gq} and situated \autocite{Klemmer:2006ez} learning and increased reflection and engagement \autocite{Rogers:2006te}. ``Being able to move around in the world and interact with pieces of the world enables learning in ways that reading books and listening to words do not''. \autocite{Klemmer:2006ez}

Yet building prototypes of sensing-based interfaces, is a complex task which requires scientists to master a wide set of skills including product design, hybrid software and electronics development; hardware construction and assembly. This is this still a relatively new area in HCI and it is characterised by the absence of a widely established toolchain to help the prototyping work. Rather, it is characterised by fast adoption of edging technologies and a pragmatic attitude at \emph{tinkering} and \emph{thinking-thrugh-prototyping} \autocite{Klemmer:2006ez}. Considering the essential role of prototypes in the development of novel technology; developing a skillset to enable rapid prototyping of hybrid software/hardware products is essential to the accomplishment of the goals sought by this PhD work.

\section{Research methodology}\label{research-methodology}

The work in this thesis is based on \emph{design research} \autocites{Hevner:2010fy}{March:1995gm}. The work followed a \emph{user centred approach} \autocites{MAGUIRE:2001dp}{Gulliksen:2003hd}, based on exploratory studies and design work in multiple iterations.

Several qualitative research methods \autocite{robson1993real} have been adopted, including shadowing and observation of crisis worker, during field studies and interviews. Scenarios, personas and mockups aided the user-centred design work. Consistently with design research methodology, grounded on the activities of \emph{building} artefacts for a specific purpose and of \emph{evaluating} how well the artefacts perform \autocite{March:1995gm}, a number of prototyping iterations and evaluation studies have been performed.

Prototyping involved the construction of sensing-based interfaces to support reflection processes. The design of prototypes was grounded in field studies during physical simulations of crisis I attended. Simple prototypes were initially used to build a deeper understanding of the crisis domain, for which I didn't have a previous knowledge. They acted as technology probes \autocite{Hutchinson:2003il} and facilitated building and understanding of the crisis domain by engaging users in focus groups. Later, multiple iterations implemented a growing set of requirements in fully working prototypes robust enough to be deployed during simulated rescue work.

User evaluations followed each design iteration \ref{fig:cromar}. The aim was both in assessing usability of the prototypes and impact on reflection outcomes. Prototypes were evaluated both during focus groups and during large simulations of crisis response work. Results from evaluations have fed following design iterations, contributed in the validation of theories on reflective learning and into the development of new constructs.

\section{Research questions}\label{research-questions}

The main research question for the PhD work is:
\begin{quote}
	MRQ: What are the opportunities introduced by combining reflective learning theories with sensing-based interfaces for supporting crisis training? 
\end{quote}

To answer the main research question the work has been broken down into three sub-questions:
\begin{quote}
	RQ1: How sensing-based interfaces can be designed to enable unobtrusive experience collection during crisis work? 
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
	RQ2: How sensing-based interfaces can be designed to trigger and support reflection activities? 
\end{quote}
\begin{quote}
	RQ3: How sensing-based interfaces for supporting reflection can be rapidly prototyped? 
\end{quote}

While the first two questions aim at investigating the design of systems to support with technology the tasks of \emph{capturing}, \emph{re-creating} and \emph{generating} work experiences; the third question investigates how toolkits and open-source communities can ease the implementation of design ideas into prototypes.

\section{Research outcomes}\label{research-outcomes}

Three are the main outcomes of this PhD work.

Seven research papers published in peer-reviewed conferences and journals explored the research questions.

Building on results reported in the papers, a body of knowledge contributing in the fields of Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL), Information Systems for Crisis Response (ISCRAM) and Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI) has been developed.

Finally research contributions have been evaluated for commercial exploitation. Five \emph{Disclosure of Invention (DOFI)} have been filed for technology transfer and early contacts with the industry have been established.

\subsection{Exploitation of research contributions}\label{exploitation-of-research-contributions}

During the final phase of the investigation, commercial exploitation of research contributions has been investigated. The focus was in assessing efforts needed and path of actions to evolve the prototypes developed as theory demonstrator into commercial products. To this end, I co-authored five \emph{Disclosure of Invention} (DOFI): technical documents that capture the description of the technologies created and establish inventorship. DOFIs were drafted based on information published in research paper (Table \ref{tab:papers-inventions})

Disclosure of inventions were filed at the NTNU Technology Transfer office\footnote{NTNU Technology Transfer AS - http://www.tto.ntnu.no}, a business incubator affiliated with NTNU, and in accordance with the Norwegian law\footnote{In accordance with ``Arbeidstakeroppfinnelsesloven'', ``Universitets og høgskoleloven'' and NTNU's internal Guidelines for innovation}. They were used by technology transfer managers to assess patent applicability and establishment of commercial activities. To this effort, I presented research results to several subjects from the industries working in the emergency management field, raising positive and supportive feedbacks. In November 2014 I was granted by NTNU Discovery \footnote{NTNU Discovery - http://ntnudiscovery.no} a 150.000NOK (c.ca 22.000USD) seed funds for financing further commercial exploration of the research results after the PhD completion.

\section{Context of the work}\label{context-of-the-work}

The research presented in this thesis is framed within the EU-funded (IST-FP7) project MIRROR\footnote{MIRROR Project - http://www.mirror-project.eu}. The objective of MIRROR is to empower and engage employees to reflect on past work performances and personal learning experiences in order to learn in “real-time” and to creatively solve pressing problems. MIRROR shall help employees to increase their level and breadth of experience significantly within short time by capturing experiences of others.  

As an associate researcher of MIRROR I took part in shaping the results of the projects by designing and implementing ICT systems, writing deliverables and attending project meetings. Thanks to MIRROR I cooperated with crisis worker associations to run field studies. I also benefited from discussions, joined works and co-authored publications with members of the consortium. After the project final review in September 2014, MIRROR has been graded as ``Excellent'' by the EU commission.

During the PhD I was a as visiting researcher in two foreign institutions: City London University\footnote{City London University - http://city.ac.uk} in London (UK) and MIT SENSEable City Lab\footnote{MIT SENSEable City Laboratory - http://senseable.mit.edu} in Boston, MA (USA). The purpose of the two visits was to investigate whether the technologies developed during the PhD could be generalised to application domains that share similarities with crisis training.

During fourteen weeks spent as visiting fellow at City University I investigated the design and production of \emph{Hazel Court}, a digitally augmented serious game for training of dementia carers for better care. I worked under the supervision of professor Neil Maiden. A working prototype of \emph{Hazel Court} (Figure \ref{fig:hazel-court}) has been implemented and evaluated in eight care homes in the greater London area. The game design and underpinning theories are reported in a joined publication to be submitted. This experience strengthened my competences in building sensing based-interfaces to support reflection in a domain which shares similarities with crisis training. It added to the study of RQ2 and RQ3.
\begin{figure}
	[h] \centering 
	\includegraphics[width=1
	\textwidth]{city} \caption{The Hazel Court prototype} \label{fig:hazel-court} 
\end{figure}

During twelve weeks spent as visiting fellow at the MIT SENSEable City Lab I investigated the design and production of a tangible interface to promote user engagement and reflection about urban-mobility data. I worked under the supervision of professor Carlo Ratti. A working prototype of \emph{DriveWAVE} (Figure \ref{fig:drivewave}) has been implemented. DriveWAVE is a tangible interface that allows casual players in public spaces to challenge a computer brain against managing car flows towards minimizing pollution and avoiding traffic jams. The installation aims at sparking the interest in future sustainable cities\footnote{For more information please visit http://senseable.mit.edu/wave/}. The prototype features sensing-based interaction with the audience via presence sensors, physical controllers and digital projections. The work has been displayed to the public in two exhibitions: ``Wave'' held in Paris and ``CNR Internet Festival'' held in Pisa, Italy. This experiences streghtned my competences in building complex sensing-based systems to be deployed in public settings and added to the investigation of RQ3.
\begin{figure}

	\textwidth]{mit} \caption{The DiveWAVE prototype} \label{fig:drivewave} 
\end{figure}

I also co-advised thesis works of eight master students who have contributed to the development of prototypes. One of them co-authored P1.
