## Crises: management, preparedness and training

In this section, I provide a brief introduction to the field of crisis management, preparedness and training. The three areas are related with training expected to produce better preparedness to a crisis event and thus better management.

### Crisis management 

The terms *crisis*, *emergency* and *disaster* are often used as synonyms. They deal with events that belong to the “un-ness” category: unexpected, undesirable, unimaginable, and often unmanageable situations [@Boin:2007wt; @hewit]. 

In this thesis the term *crisis* refers to a single or sequence of problematic events that may lead to a dangerous situation, whether that is an emergency or a disaster. While an *emergency* is a episode that requires immediate attention, but usually on a small scale, it can turn in a *disaster* if left unattended. For example high rainfall could lead to several emergencies (e.g. car crashes, flooded bridges) and might eventually turn into a disaster (e.g. a massive flooding or an hurricane). Disaster can be caused by nature or humans and might show or not show early signals that allow the disaster to be avoided or mitigated. Disasters have a huge impact on societies, in terms of loss of human lives and costs: over the last 35 years, the frequency of disasters has increased five-fold and the damage caused, has multiplied by approximately eight times [^eudisaster]. 

Yet, although troubles are getting more frequent, people’s ability of dealing with adverse events is also growing [@Boin:2009bv]. Activating effective management strategies during a crisis, can avoid or reduce the extent of an emergency or a disaster; save human lives and reduce costs for managing and recovering from a disaster. For this reason improving crisis management practices is a priority for many countries, including the European ones [^eudisaster].   

Providing better crisis management is not easy task. This is due to the nature of crisis work as a complex, inter-organisational activity, often without clear start or end, and involving many different roles. Examples of roles and activities typical of crisis management are police forces to constrain access to a disaster scene, firefighters to explore and map undisclosed areas, paramedics to activate triage and hospitalise injured, fellow citizen to report information and stay out of dangers. Crisis management requires coordination on multiple levels, from team leaders (intra-organisation) up to disaster managers (inter-organisation). \todo{This paragraph needs to be improved, add reference}

### Crisis preparedness 

The effort to provide better crisis management is known as *crisis preparedness*. It is a collective activity which includes fellow citizens, crisis workers (trained volunteers and professionals to provide help to the persons in need during crises) and institutions at multiple levels. 

Getting prepared to a crisis is a continuos process focusing on two main activities, *prevention* and *response* [@Deverell:2009fk], in order to:
1. Prevent a crisis from happening includes risk mitigation activities, monitoring the environment and raising awareness in the population about what to do to when a crisis occurs. 
2. Getting ready to promptly response when a crisis occurs, in order to be able to overtake it with little damages as possible and to mitigate its impact on the population. It includes activities related to protocol formalisation and training of crisis workers. 

Training of crisis workers, hereafter *Crisis Training*, is therefore a critical activity to improve crisis management.\todo{Add reference} The different approaches to crisis training are described in the next section. 

### Crisis Training

Crisis training refers to activities both to teach rescue protocols, e.g. medical procedures, and to enhance “*soft skills*”, e.g. communication styles, stress management and coping strategies [@Sagun:2009ks]. 

Simulated crises are events that try to follow as much as possible events and context from real ones, in terms of environment, tasks and challenges, stress and emotions. Examples are: table-top exercises, small to large-scale physical simulations, serious games and virtual worlds. Simulated crises are used for experiential learning for different roles: while tabletop exercises are often performed at the strategic level by coordinators and disaster managers, serious games usually target specific roles; physical simulations involve a wide range of roles. \todo{Articulate better the different types of crisis training activities}

*Experiential learning* is a learning approach to complement traditional formal methods (e.g. classroom teaching of procedure, protocols and best practices) that can be applied to crisis training. As described in SectionX it makes use of experiences, reflection in order to achieve a learning outcome. Although the important role of experiences as triggers for achieve organisational learning is acknowledged [@Deverell:2009fk, @Larsson:2010jr], learning by experience and lesson drawing are still quite unexplored areas of crisis management [@Lagadec:1997js; @Boin:2007wt; @Stern:1997eb]. In the next section I focus on activities related experiential learning and how technology has been employed to support it.

## Experiential learning as a tool for Crisis Training

Experiences from real and simulated crises can be used as triggers to achieve organisational learning [@Deverell:2009fk]. Organisational learning may occur “when experience systematically alter behaviour or knowledge” [@Schwab:2007iw, p.233]; as an effort to gain knowledge from the past (e.g. an earlier crisis exercise) and use it when managing a new crisis, to correct previous mistakes [@Larsson:2010jr]. As stated by Hillyard [-@Hillyard:SYlJRQLN], organisational learning is one of the basic objective of crisis management, which is to accumulated wisdom by “learning together from the event in order to prevent, lessen the severity of, or improve upon responses to future crises”. In CM the correct action to take often can only be derived from experience. e.g. handling of the events in similar situations.

*Yet, how work experiences during simulated crises can produce a learning outcome? And what are those learning outcomes? How they will impact on crisis management*?

First off experiential learning from crises is not an easy job. While learning during the work, or *intra-crisis*, is very difficult due to time pressure, stress and demands for rapid action [@Deverell:2009fk] and because learning is typically a retrospective exercise [@jasanoff1994learning]; *inter-crisis* learning is also challenging. Moynihan [-@Moynihan:2008gq] identify ten barriers to effective crisis learning. Among those the high consequentiality of crises makes experiential learning costly [@LaPorte:1991gk], moreover the specificity of each crisis event makes hard to apply learning outcomes from one crisis to another. Yet crises also offer learning opportunities, “Experience from previous events can be usefully applied to similar crises and represent a form of learning from the past” [@Moynihan:2008gq]     

In order to turn experiences into knowledge debriefing after real or simulated crisis-work offers important learning opportunities [@Boin:2007wt]. Debriefing involves “reviewing a difficult episode from a constructive point of view … the goal is to extract fundamental lessons learned from the way the event was handled” [@Lagadec:1997js]. It is a collaborative activity involving multiple roles. 

The outcome which debriefing seeks to obtain is lesson drawing. Previous work experiences provide a good source of lesson-drawing which may potentially affect managing, planning and training for future crises. Yet lessons-drawing is often one of the most neglected aspects of crisis management [@Lagadec:1997js; @Stern:1997eb]. Studies [@Lagadec:1997js] has show that the introduction of debriefings meet resistance. This might be due to lack of commitment but also to barriers like costs, lack of data to feed the debriefing, lack of tools to provide meaningful visualisation or to recreate a work experience. In the following I describe out technology can help in lowering those barriers.

A outlined by Boud et al. [-@boud1985reflection] debriefing is a form of collaborative reflection. During debriefings, a re-evaluation of experience takes place, with explicit attention to emotions, ideas and behaviours. Reflection is therefore a critical activity to achieve experiential learning. 

### Technology support for experiential learning 

Technology can provide support to experiential learning in many ways. For example it can be used to capture a work experience, to simulate or re-create a specific crisis, to provide support to coordination, for data collection or to assist debriefings. The common denominator is that technology can add realism to exercises, in order to re-create experiences that are as close as possible to real crisis, and allow trainees to experience emotions (e.g. stress) of a similar nature and intensity as the ones experience under a real emergency [@MacKinnon:2012wz]. Adding realism to the training experience is recognised to be a key for achieving learning outcomes [@Asproth:2013vs].  

In this thesis I focus on using technology to:

(i) capture work experiences from multiple point of views, 

(ii) re-create those experiences for debriefing purposes using the data captured,

(iii) generated new work experiences for training purposes. 

In order to ground the design of technology into theory on reflective learning I adopted the MIRROR CSRL model [@Krogstie:2013kf] and the MIRROR toolbox [@Knipfer:2012vi] to evaluate the learning outcomes produced. 

In the next chapter I provide a brief introduction on computer-supported reflective learning and the model used as theoretical underpinning for the technology contributions of this thesis.
