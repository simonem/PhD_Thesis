# Crisis, management and learning

In this section, I provide a brief interaction to the field of crisis management, crisis preparedness and training.

## Crisis management and preparedness

The terms *crisis*, *emergency* and *disaster* are often used as synonyms. As pointed out by [@Boin:2007wt] and [@hewit] they deal with events that belong in the “un-ness” category: unexpected, undesirable, unimaginable, and often unmanageable situations. 

We can refer to *crisis* as an event that is expected to lead to a dangerous situation, whether it’s an emergency or a disaster. While an *emergency* is a episode that requires immediate attention, but usually on a small scale, it can turn in a *disaster* if left unattended. For example high rainfall could lead to several emergencies (e.g. car crashes, flooded bridges) and eventually in a disaster (e.g. a massive flooding or an hurricane). Over the last 35 years, the frequency of natural and human-made disaster has increased five-fold and the damage caused has multiplied by approximately eight times [@union:Mz-lFgLc]. 

Yet, although disasters are getting more frequent, people’s capacity of dealing with adverse events is also growing [@Boin:2009bv] and this is thanks to the advances in crisis preparedness and management, which are a priority for many countries, including the European ones [@union:Mz-lFgLc].   

Crisis management is a complex, inter-organisational activity to provide help to the person in need during natural or human-made disaster. Examples of roles and activities typical of crisis management are police forces to constrain access to a disaster scene, firefighters to explore and map undisclosed areas, paramedics to activate triage and hospitalise injured, fellow citizen to report information and stay out of dangers. Crisis management requires coordination on multiple levels, from team leaders (intra-organisation) up to disaster managers (inter-organisation).    

Although crisis management is activated only when a crisis occurs, crisis preparedness is a continuos process aiming at improving crisis management. Crisis preparedness focuses on:
(i) prevent a crisis from happening, with risk mitigation activities, monitoring the environment and raising awareness in the population
(ii) getting prepared about what to do when a crisis occurs, in order to prevent disasters or to mitigate their impact on the population. It includes activities related to protocol formalisation and training of crisis workers or crisis training.  Learning and training are core activities to achieve better  crisis preparedness.

## Crisis training

Crisis training refers to many activities spanning different lengths of time, targeting two user groups: crisis worker and the population. While training the population addresses activities to spread awareness about what to do to avoid, or to better cope with disasters; training of crisis workers refer to activities both to teach rescue protocols and to enhance “*soft skills*”: communication styles, stress management and coping strategies [@Sagun:2009ks]. In this thesis we focus on the latter user group: crisis workers.

### Learning by experience

There are two main approaches to crisis training: formal learning (e.g. classroom learning) and *learning by experience* during real or simulated crises.

Simulated crises, are event that try to follow as much as possible events and context from real ones: they might include table-top exercises, and small to large-scale physical simulations, serious games and virtual worlds. Those activities address a wide range of roles: tabletop exercise are often performed at the strategic level by coordinators and disaster managers; physical simulation often involve a wide range of roles. 

Experiences from simulated [?] and real crisis can be used as triggers to achieve organisational learning [@Deverell:2009fk]. Organisational learning may occur “when experience systematically alter behaviour or knowledge” [@Schwab:2007iw, p.233] as an effort to gain knowledge from the past (e.g. an earlier crisis) and use it when managing a new crisis, to correct previous mistakes [@Larsson:2010jr]. As stated by Hillyard [-@Hillyard:SYlJRQLN], organisational learning is one of the basic objective of crisis management, which is to accumulated wisdom by “learning together from the event in order to prevent, lessen the severity of, or improve upon responses to future crises”.

Yet, how work experiences during crisis work can produce a learning outcome? And what are those learning outcomes?

First off learning from crisis is not an easy job. While learning during the work, or *intra-crisis*, is very difficult due to time pressure, stress and demands for rapid action [@Deverell:2009fk] and because learning is typically a retrospective exercise [@jasanoff1994learning]; *inter-crisis* learning is also challenging. Moynihan [-@Moynihan:2008gq] identify ten barriers to effective crisis learning. Among those the high consequentiality of crises makes experiential learning prohibitively costly [@LaPorte:1991gk], moreover the specificity of each crisis event makes hard to apply learning outcomes from one crisis to another.

Yet crisis also offers learning opportunities, “Experience from previous events can be usefully applied to similar crises and represent a form of learning from the past” [@Moynihan:2008gq]     

### Debriefings as a tool for learning from experience 

In order to turn experiences into knowledge [correct?!] debriefing after real or simulated crisis-work offers important learning opportunities [@Boin:2007wt]. Debriefing is a core activity to learn from work experiences during real crisis and to increase the impact of any training event. It is a collaborative activity involving multiple roles. 

### Lesson drawing as a learning outcome

The outcome of debriefing is lesson drawing. Previous work experiences provide good source of lesson-drawing which may potentially affect managing, planning and training for future crises. Yet lessons-drawing is often one of the most neglected aspects of crisis management [@Lagadec:1997js; @Stern:1997eb].

lessons drawing are an important learning outcome

A outlined by Boud et al. [-@boud1985reflection] debriefing is a form of collaborative reflection. During debriefings, a re-evaluation of experience takes place, with explicit attention to emotions, ideas and behaviours. 

## Technology support to Crisis Training

Technology can provide support to crisis training in many ways. For example it can be used to simulate or re-create a specific crisis, to provide support to coordination, for data collection or to assist debriefings. Moreover technology can be used to add realism to exercises, in order to re-create experiences that are as close as possible to real crisis, and allow trainees to experience emotions (e.g. stress) of a similar nature and intensity as the ones experience under a real emergency [@MacKinnon:2012wz]. Adding realism is connected to capturing real data to add that realism

In order to re-create experiences two tools are available: tabletop exercises (e.g. [@Nielson:2012vb]) and serious games.

Being debriefing a form of reflection we can use the CSRL model to address it with technology
