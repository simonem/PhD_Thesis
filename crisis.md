# Crises, work and learning

In this section, I provide a brief introduction to the field of crisis management, crisis preparedness and learning.

## Crisis work and preparedness

The terms *crisis*, *emergency* and *disaster* are often used as synonyms. As pointed out by [@Boin:2007wt] and [@hewit] they deal with events that belong in the “un-ness” category: unexpected, undesirable, unimaginable, and often unmanageable situations. 

We can refer to *crisis* as an event that is expected to lead to a dangerous situation, whether it’s an emergency or a disaster. While an *emergency* is a episode that requires immediate attention, but usually on a small scale, it can turn in a *disaster* if left unattended. For example high rainfall could lead to several emergencies (e.g. car crashes, flooded bridges) and might eventually turn in a disaster (e.g. a massive flooding or an hurricane). Disaster can be caused by nature or human-made and show or not show early signals that allow the disaster to be avoided. Over the last 35 years, the frequency of disasters has increased five-fold and the damage caused has multiplied by approximately eight times [@union:Mz-lFgLc]. 

Yet, although disasters are getting more frequent, people’s capacity of dealing with adverse events is also growing [@Boin:2009bv] and this is thanks to the advances in crisis preparedness and management, which are a priority for many countries, including the European ones [@union:Mz-lFgLc].   

Crisis management is a complex, inter-organisational activity to provide help to the persons in need during a crisis. Examples of roles and activities typical of crisis management are police forces to constrain access to a disaster scene, firefighters to explore and map undisclosed areas, paramedics to activate triage and hospitalise injured, fellow citizen to report information and stay out of dangers. Crisis management requires coordination on multiple levels, from team leaders (intra-organisation) up to disaster managers (inter-organisation).    

Meanwhile crisis management is activated only when a crisis occurs, crisis preparedness is a continuos process aiming at improving crisis management practices using training activities to induce learning outcomes. Crisis-induced learning (hereafter crisis learning) focuses on two main activities, both essential for organisational resilience: *prevention* and *response* [@Deverell:2009fk], in order to
(i) prevent a crisis from happening, ~~with risk mitigation activities, monitoring the environment and raising awareness in the population~~
(ii) getting prepared about what to do when a crisis occurs, in order to prevent disasters or to mitigate their impact on the population. ~~It includes activities related to protocol formalisation and training of crisis workers or crisis training.  Learning and training are core activities to achieve better  crisis preparedness~~.

## Crisis learning

Crisis learning refers to many activities spanning different lengths of time, targeting two user groups: crisis worker and the population. While training the population addresses activities to spread awareness about what to do to avoid, or to better cope with disasters; training of crisis workers refer to activities both to teach rescue protocols and to enhance “*soft skills*”: communication styles, stress management and coping strategies [@Sagun:2009ks]. In this thesis we focus on the latter user group: crisis workers.

There are two main approaches to crisis learning for workers: *formal learning*, e.g. teaching of protocols and best practices, and *learning by experience*. Both are means to achieve better crisis management practices. While the former is traditionally done on books or collaboratively in a classroom setting, the latter in done during real or simulated crises. Simulated crises are events that try to follow as much as possible events and context from real ones, in terms of environment, tasks and challenges, stress and emotions. Examples are: table-top exercises, small to large-scale physical simulations, serious games and virtual worlds. Simulated crises are used for experiential learning for different roles: while tabletop exercises are often performed at the strategic level by coordinators and disaster managers, serious games usually target specific roles; physical simulations involve a wide range of roles. 

Learning by experience and lesson drawing are still quite unexplored areas of crisis management [@Lagadec:1997js; @Boin:2007wt; @Stern:1997eb], in which technology can play a role role boh in helping capturing experiences and re-creating them providing a context as close as possible to real crises. In the remaining section I focus on activities related experiential learning and how technology has been employed to support it.

### Learning by experience

Experiences from real and simulated crises can be used as triggers to achieve organisational learning [@Deverell:2009fk]. Organisational learning may occur “when experience systematically alter behaviour or knowledge” [@Schwab:2007iw, p.233]; as an effort to gain knowledge from the past (e.g. an earlier crisis exercise) and use it when managing a new crisis, to correct previous mistakes [@Larsson:2010jr]. As stated by Hillyard [-@Hillyard:SYlJRQLN], organisational learning is one of the basic objective of crisis management, which is to accumulated wisdom by “learning together from the event in order to prevent, lessen the severity of, or improve upon responses to future crises”.

Yet, how work experiences during crisis work can produce a learning outcome? And what are those learning outcomes?

First off learning from crises is not an easy job. While learning during the work, or *intra-crisis*, is very difficult due to time pressure, stress and demands for rapid action [@Deverell:2009fk] and because learning is typically a retrospective exercise [@jasanoff1994learning]; *inter-crisis* learning is also challenging. Moynihan [-@Moynihan:2008gq] identify ten barriers to effective crisis learning. Among those the high consequentiality of crises makes experiential learning costly [@LaPorte:1991gk], moreover the specificity of each crisis event makes hard to apply learning outcomes from one crisis to another.

Yet crises also offer learning opportunities, “Experience from previous events can be usefully applied to similar crises and represent a form of learning from the past” [@Moynihan:2008gq]     

### Debriefing as a tool for learning from experiences		 

In order to turn experiences into knowledge [correct?] debriefing after real or simulated crisis-work offers important learning opportunities [@Boin:2007wt]. Debriefing involves “reviewing a difficult episode from a constructive point of view  … the goal is to extract fundamental lessons learned from the ay the event was handled” [@Lagadec:1997js]. It is a collaborative activity involving multiple roles. 

A outlined by Boud et al. [-@boud1985reflection] debriefing is a form of collaborative reflection.. During debriefings, a re-evaluation of experience takes place, with explicit attention to emotions, ideas and behaviours. 

The outcome which debriefing seeks to obtain is lesson drawing. Previous work experiences provide a good source of lesson-drawing which may potentially affect managing, planning and training for future crises. Yet lessons-drawing is often one of the most neglected aspects of crisis management [@Lagadec:1997js; @Stern:1997eb]. Studies [@Lagadec:1997js] has show that the introduction of debriefings meet resistance. This might be due to lack of commitment but also to barriers like costs, lack of data to feed the debriefing, lack of tools to provide meaningful visualisation or to recreate a work experience. In the following I describe out technology can help in lowering those barriers.

## Technology support for experiential learning 

Technology can provide support to experiential learning in many ways. For example it can be used to capture a work experience, to simulate or re-create a specific crisis, to provide support to coordination, for data collection or to assist debriefings. The common denominator is that technology can add realism to exercises, in order to re-create experiences that are as close as possible to real crisis, and allow trainees to experience emotions (e.g. stress) of a similar nature and intensity as the ones experience under a real emergency [@MacKinnon:2012wz]. Adding realism to the training experience is recognised to be a key for achieving learning outcomes [@Asproth:2013vs].  

In this thesis I focus on using technology for (i) capturing work experiences and (ii) leveraging the captured data to re-create those experiences for debriefing purposes. Being debriefing a form of collaborative reflection [@boud1985reflection] I adopted the MIRROR CSRL model [@Krogstie:2013kf] as a framework to drive the design of computer interfaces and the MIRROR toolbox for evaluation purposes [@Knipfer:2012vi].
