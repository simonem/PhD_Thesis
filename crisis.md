## Crises: preparedness and management

In this section, I provide a brief introduction to the field of crisis management and preparedness. The two areas are related  better preparedness to a crisis event expected to produce better management.

### Crisis management 

The terms *crisis*, *emergency* and *disaster* are often used as synonyms. They deal with events that belong to the “un-ness” category: unexpected, undesirable, unimaginable, and often unmanageable situations [@Boin:2007wt; @hewit]. In this space made up of both foreseeable and unexpected elements, crisis management works anticipating the former in order to minimise the latter[^blog].

In this thesis the term *crisis* refers to a single or sequence of problematic events that may lead to a dangerous situation, whether that is an emergency or a disaster. While an *emergency* is a episode that requires immediate attention, but usually on a small scale, it can turn in a *disaster* if left unattended. For example high rainfall could lead to several emergencies (e.g. car crashes, flooded bridges) and might eventually turn into a disaster (e.g. a massive flooding or an hurricane). Disaster can be caused by nature or humans and might show or not show early signals that allow the disaster to be avoided or mitigated. Disasters have a huge impact on societies, in terms of loss of human lives and costs: over the last 35 years, the frequency of disasters has increased five-fold and the damage caused, has multiplied by approximately eight times [^eudisaster]. 

Yet, although troubles are getting more frequent, people’s ability of dealing with adverse events is also growing [@Boin:2009bv]. Activating effective management strategies during a crisis, can avoid or reduce the extent of an emergency or a disaster; save human lives and reduce costs for managing and recovering from a disaster. For this reason improving crisis management practices is a priority for many countries, including the European ones [^eudisaster].   

Examples of roles and activities typical of crisis management are police forces to constrain access to a disaster scene, firefighters to explore and map undisclosed areas, paramedics to activate triage and hospitalise injured, fellow citizen to report information and stay out of dangers. Crisis management requires coordination on multiple levels, from team leaders (intra-organisation) up to disaster managers (inter-organisation). \todo{This paragraph needs to be improved, add reference}
\todo[inline]{Example of crisis management scenario}

Providing better crisis management is not easy task. This is due to the nature of crisis work as a complex, inter-organisational activity, often without clear start or end, and involving many different roles.     

### Crisis preparedness 

The effort to provide better crisis management is known as *crisis preparedness*. It is a collective activity which involves fellow citizens, crisis workers (trained volunteers and professionals to provide help to the persons in need) and institutions at multiple levels. 

Getting prepared to a crisis is a continuos process focusing on two areas, *prevention* and *response* [@Deverell:2009fk]
\missingfigure{timeline before-during crisis}

**Prevention** refers to activities aiming at avoiding a crisis from happening; e.g. mitigating risks by monitoring the environment and raising awareness in the population about what to do to when a crisis occurs. 

**Response** is concerned with getting ready to promptly react when a crisis occurs, in order to be able to overtake it with little damages as possible and to mitigate its impact on the population. It includes activities related to protocol formalisation and training of crisis workers. 

Training of crisis workers, hereafter *Crisis Training*, is therefore a critical activity to improve crisis management because it deals with the ability of people to react to a crisis and reduce the risks of turing into a emergency or disaster. As matter of facts, previous research has shown that the outcome of a disaster is highly correlated with preparation and training prior the beginning of the crisis [@Asproth:cb]. \todo{Add more reference} 

The different approaches and activities related to crisis training are described in the next section. 

## Crisis Training

Four approaches to crisis training have been identified. They share the goal to produce learning outcomes towards providing better crisis management. The presented approaches are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary.\todo{Couldn’t find any reference to support this}

*Protocol training* - Those are activities related to teaching of procedures, protocols and best practices. This is often the first type of training given to newcomers. \todo{Technology can…}

*Tabletop exercises* -  Often performed at the strategic level, it usually involves disaster managers to gather together and talk through a simulated disaster. Usually there’s little realism in a tabletop exercise[^epa]: equipments are not used, resources are not deployed in space and time constraints are not introduced. Usually tabletop exercises run for few hours, the limited scale of the exercises make them a cost-effective tool to validate plans and activities.

*Physical simulation* - Those are large-scale events that try to follow as much as possible events and context from real ones, in terms of environment, tasks and challenges, stress and emotions. Simulated crisis events can run for days, they take place on location using, as much as possible, equipments and personnel that would be on deployed on a real event. Yet some of the factor present in real crises cannot be simulated. Simulations involves a wide range of roles from disaster manager, to team leaders and field workers. They are highly costly events and for this reason are run sporadically; it is therefore important to maximise their learning outcomes. The field studies performed during this PhD research have been conducted during this kind of training activities.

*Serious games* - They aims to tech useful skills for crisis management leveraging the “fun” aspect of the game as a motivator to play repeatedly and therefore gain multiple perspectives [@DiLoreto:2012bj]. Rather than aiming at teaching *hard skills*  like protocols and best practices, serious games have the potential of enhance *soft skills* e.g. communication styles, stress management and coping strategies [@Sagun:2009ks]. Those skills are useful both for prevention and for response to a crisis. Serious games bridge the gap between tabletop exercises and physical simulations: they are more realistic than the former yet without the huge costs of the latter. They are played multiple times, both by individuals and collaboratively by teams. Multiple games can address a variety of roles and tasks: Being a lightweight training tool, each games can have learning objective tailored on a specific learning objective. Games varies from board game to highly immersive virtual environments, for a review see [@DiLoreto:2012bj].

With the first approach presented relying on formal learning, the last approaches can benefit from *informal learning* techniques (experiential learning, tacit knowledge, …); being focused workers training hard and soft skills by doing some extent of real work. This PhD thesis is focused on supporting with technology training activities that can benefit from informal learning techniques. 

### Experiential learning as a tool to improve Crisis Training

*Experiential learning* is an informal learning approach that makes use of work experiences and reflection in order to achieve learning outcomes. Although the important role of experiences as triggers for achieve organisational learning is acknowledged [@Deverell:2009fk, @Larsson:2010jr], learning by experience and lesson drawing are still quite unexplored areas of crisis management [@Lagadec:1997js; @Boin:2007wt; @Stern:1997eb]. 

Experiences from real and simulated crises can be used as triggers to achieve organisational learning [@Deverell:2009fk]. Organisational learning may occur “when experience systematically alter behaviour or knowledge” [@Schwab:2007iw, p.233]; as an effort to gain knowledge from the past (e.g. an earlier crisis exercise) and use it when managing a new crisis, to correct previous mistakes [@Larsson:2010jr]. As stated by Hillyard [-@Hillyard:SYlJRQLN], organisational learning is one of the basic objective of crisis management, which is to accumulated wisdom by “learning together from the event in order to prevent, lessen the severity of, or improve upon responses to future crises”. In CM the correct action to take often can only be derived from experience. e.g. handling of the events in similar situations.

Yet, learning from experiences of crisis management work is not easy. While learning during a crisis, or *intra-crisis*, is very difficult due to time pressure, stress and demands for rapid action [@Deverell:2009fk] and because learning is typically a retrospective exercise [@jasanoff1994learning]; *inter-crisis* learning is also challenging. Moynihan [-@Moynihan:2008gq] identify ten barriers to effective crisis learning. Among those the high consequentiality of crises makes experiential learning costly [@LaPorte:1991gk], moreover the specificity of each crisis event makes hard to apply learning outcomes from one crisis to another. ~~Yet crises also offer learning opportunities, “Experience from previous events can be usefully applied to similar crises and represent a form of learning from the past” [@Moynihan:2008gq~~].

*Therefore, how work experiences can produce a learning outcome? And what are those learning outcomes? How they will impact on crisis management*?

Work experiences can be turned into knowledge thanks to the reflective practice. Reflecting on action allows workers to learn from past experiences with the goal of performing better in the future [@boud1985reflection; @Schon:1983ut].

Theory in reflective learning and mobile and embedded computing are two key elements to make crisis training based on reflection on work experiences effective. The two domains are interrelated, with the role of theory to inform the design of technology.

In the remaining of this thesis, theoretical frameworks presented in the next chapter describe on how to assist reflection by identifying relevant activities and *cycles* of activities. SectionX show how technology can assist those activities, for example providing sensors for capturing different aspects of experiences, user interfaces facilitate the practitioner in reflecting the information captured and infrastructures to share data and reflection outcomes among practitioners.

## Debriefing
In order to turn experiences into knowledge debriefing after real or simulated crisis-work offers important learning opportunities [@Boin:2007wt]. Debriefing involves “reviewing a difficult episode from a constructive point of view … the goal is to extract fundamental lessons learned from the way the event was handled” [@Lagadec:1997js]. It is a collaborative activity involving multiple roles. 

The outcome which debriefing seeks to obtain is lesson drawing. Previous work experiences provide a good source of lesson-drawing which may potentially affect managing, planning and training for future crises. Yet lessons-drawing is often one of the most neglected aspects of crisis management [@Lagadec:1997js; @Stern:1997eb]. Studies [@Lagadec:1997js] has show that the introduction of debriefings meet resistance. This might be due to lack of commitment but also to barriers like costs, lack of data to feed the debriefing, lack of tools to provide meaningful visualisation or to recreate a work experience. In the following I describe out technology can help in lowering those barriers.

A outlined by Boud et al. [-@boud1985reflection] debriefing is a form of collaborative reflection. During debriefings, a re-evaluation of experience takes place, with explicit attention to emotions, ideas and behaviours. Reflection is therefore a critical activity to achieve experiential learning. It can be augmented with technology…

### Technology support for crisis training 

Technology can provide support to experiential learning in many ways. For example it can be used to capture a work experience, to simulate or re-create a specific crisis, to provide support to coordination, for data collection or to assist debriefings. The common denominator is that technology can add realism to exercises, in order to re-create experiences that are as close as possible to real crisis, and allow trainees to experience emotions (e.g. stress) of a similar nature and intensity as the ones experience under a real emergency [@MacKinnon:2012wz]. Adding realism to the training experience is recognised to be a key for achieving learning outcomes [@Asproth:2013vs].  

In this thesis I focus on using technology to:

(i) capture work experiences from multiple point of views, 

(ii) re-create those experiences for debriefing purposes using the data captured,

(iii) generated new work experiences for training purposes. 

In order to ground the design of technology into theory on reflective learning I adopted the MIRROR CSRL model [@Krogstie:2013kf] and the MIRROR toolbox [@Knipfer:2012vi] to evaluate the learning outcomes produced. 

In the next chapter I provide a brief introduction on computer-supported reflective learning and the model used as theoretical underpinning for this research work and I discuss how it can improve experiential crisis learning
