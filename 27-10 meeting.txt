check practicalities
abstract -> applications are not contributions
focus on technology or IS (apps for understanding crisis training, in this case apps are tools)

impl of csrl weakness and pro

missing overview of implication for design
summarise contributions at the beginning

relate each of the tudies tp wjat I've learnt from it

evaluation: weakness of the studies

flesh out the pratcial problem
whys simulations are costly, why simulations are inefficient 

research question are too much hinting int the direction of solution. how can we improve collection of data during a crisis simulation

about the problem -> checl project description of mirror

delete supporting and sharnig experiences

focus early on crisis training

short description of one training event

small model or scenario about what crisis training is for me

csrl applied to the design of technology, make clear that is a semplification of the model

UCD as a tool functional do design science method

connect the timeline to a methoodological framework
