## Evaluation of Research questions

### MRQ: How technology can introduce new opportunities to promote reflection on work experiences?

The main research question is answered by Contribution 1. Using *crisis training* as case study for design research, it is demonstrated how conceptual tools from theory in CSRL can be implemented in a suite of technology applications: WATCHiT, CroMAR, Trainer and Don’t Panic (DoomTown). Each application assists a specific activity which the CSRL model has identified to be relevant for reflection: plan and do work, monitor work, initiate and conduct reflection session. Two or more applications can be configured to work together in an ecology, in order to address the interrelated nature of CSRL activities in terms of sharing data and reflection outcomes. In this way it is also addressed the need for supporting the extremely vast range of crisis-work scenarios workers train for by means of loosely coupled, modular applications.

### RQ1: How ~~sensor-based~~ computer interfaces can enable pervasive and unobtrusive data collection at work?

This question is answered by Contribution 2 and Contribution 3. C2 identified a set of challenges for designing data capturing tools, focusing on *what* data to collect and *how* to collect it. One of the identified challenges, the need of intuitive and hands-free user interfaces for capturing user-submitted qualitative information, has been further addressed by C3 with the design of a novel interaction technique.  

### RQ2: What interaction modalities with digital information can help in engaging reflection processes?

This question is answered by Contribution 3. It is found out that theory in the field of tangible, embodied and embedded computing can drive the design of interaction modalities with the digital world either for *capture work experiences* and to *generate work experiences*. The specific paradigms put in use are mobile augmented reality, body-centric interaction and token+constraint interaction. Once more it is not a single interaction modality that has been proven to engage reflection but rather a mix of different technology-assisted experiences. 

### RQ3: How technology tools for supporting reflection can be rapid prototyped?

This question is answered by Contribution 4. It is found out that prototyping tools for supporting reflection require a wide range of skills ranging from software and electronic engineering and industrial design. Yet a toolbox for assisting in full the work of designers and engineers in implementing functional requirements in prototypes couldn’t be identified. Despite so recent advances in open source hardware and software, digital manufacturing and technology developed by the author (P7) allowed the author to build working prototypes robust enough to undergo evaluations during simulated crisis work. Still the production of prototypes for supporting reflection require a lot of resources in terms of time, money and skills not usually available among the research communities this PhD work belongs to.
